(B) H&amp;E staining demonstrated atypical squamous cells with the formation of cancer pearls deeply proliferated from the epithelium on the upper portion (×20). The inset shows a high-powered view of the area in the red rectangle (×200). (C) The elevated lesion with white moss on the hard palate was apparent. (D) Direct tumor invasion into the right maxillary sinus and nasal cavity through the bottom of the maxillary bone in a view of the coronal section (red circle). (E) A map of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) irradiation indicating that the right eye ball was out of focus. The rainbow map was designed as non-uniform irradiation area. Total estimated dose on the center was 7,494.9 cGy. (F) The white elevated moss disappeared and was replaced by slightly necrotic tissue (arrowheads). (G) The tumor was not detected by magnetic resonance imaging after IMRT treatment.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34341643/" target="_blank">34341643</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
