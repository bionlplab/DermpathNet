(A) If only one antibody had to be positive to diagnose HNSCC, the sensitivity increased to 98.7% and the specificity decreased to 47.3%. The new AUC value was 0.730. (B) If both antibodies had to show a positive reaction, the sensitivity was 87.2%, specificity improved to 87.9%, and the AUC value was 0.876. (C, D) Expression of CAV1 and LGALS7 in tumour cells of a lung tumour in a patient with HNSCC, which was immunohistochemically classified as met‐HNSCC (total magnification ×50). (E, F) No expression of CAV1 and LGALS7 in a lung tumour in a patient with HNSCC, which was immunohistochemically classified as SQCLC (E, total magnification ×100; F, total magnification ×50). (G, H) Weak expression of CAV1 and no expression of LGALS7 in a lung tumour in a patient with HNSCC, which was immunohistochemically classified as uncertain (total magnification ×50).</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34647699/" target="_blank">34647699</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
