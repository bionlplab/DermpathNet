The tumor was well circumscribed and had partially invaded the fatty tissue (Hematoxylin–eosin (H and E), original magnification, × 13) (b). The tumor was an atypical squamoproliferative lesion composed of atypical, keratinizing tumor islands, and infiltrating strands with moderate to high grade nuclear atypia, consistent with SCC (H and E, original magnification × 100) (c). At the periphery of the tumor, atypical keratinocytes in the deeper portions of the epidermis and solar elastosis in the dermis were seen, consistent with actinic keratosis (H and E, original magnification × 200) (b) and (c) are high magnification images of the regions in (a) indicated by † and ‡, respectively</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24891672/" target="_blank">24891672</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
