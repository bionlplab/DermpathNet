OSCC cases were categorized as well- (A-C), moderately (D-I), and poorly (J-O) differentiated. In well-differentiated OSCC, YAP and ΔNp63 expression was found at tumor borders; YAP and ΔNp63 were observed in cell nuclei (A-C). Moderately differentiated OSCC displayed two patterns that tended to have maturation or less maturation (D and G). In the former, YAP and ΔNp63 expression levels were similar to those in well-differentiated OSCC (D-F). In the latter, YAP and ΔNp63 expression patterns were similar to those in poorly differentiated OSCC (G-I). In poorly differentiated OSCC, YAP and ΔNp63 were expressed in nearly all malignant epithelial cells; YAP was strongly observed in cell cytoplasm or nuclei, while ΔNp63 was seen in cell nuclei (J-O). Bars: 20 μm.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31217745/" target="_blank">31217745</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
