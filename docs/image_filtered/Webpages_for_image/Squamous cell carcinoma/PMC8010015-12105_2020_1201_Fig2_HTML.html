Oral squamous cell carcinoma showing invasion in the form of discrete large islands consisting &gt;15cells (WPOI3) and a strong continuous lymphoid response around the periphery of the whole tumour (black arrows). In the absence of perineural invasion; this is classified as a low risk tumour (risk score 0). (b) H&amp;E × 40. Oral squamous cell carcinoma showing invasion in the form of discrete small islands and groups comprising less than 15 cells (WPOI4) featuring a barely discernible lymphoid host response at the invasive front (black arrows). Even in the absence of PNI the total risk score would be at least 4 with the tumour classified as high risk. (c) H&amp;E × 20. Oral squamous cell carcinoma showing widely dispersed invasion with a single small group of malignant cells (black circle) situated more than 1 mm ahead of the main tumour (black star). This pattern of invasion equates to WPOI5 and carries a risk score of 3; rendering the tumour as tumour high risk regardless of LHR and PNI status. (d) H&amp;E × 40. Oral squamous cell carcinoma showing an LHR of variable density with stronger (black arrow) and weaker zones (red arrow). This incomplete distribution of lymphoid cells at the invasive front is considered intermediate (risk score 1). (e) H&amp;E × 200. Oral squamous cell carcinoma showing perineural invasion of a small nerve of &lt;1 mm (black star). The tumour (black arrows) shows complete cirumferential invasion of the nerve. This finding carries a risk score of 1 and would require combination with an unfavourable pattern of invasion or lymphoid host response in order 
to qualify as a high risk tumour. (f) H&amp;E × 200. Oral squamous cell carcinoma showing obvious perineural invasion of a large nerve &gt;1 mm diameter (black star). The tumour (red star) shows almost complete circumferential invasion of the nerve. This finding carries a risk score of 3 and immediately qualifies a tumour as high risk regardless of WPOI or LHR status</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32661668/" target="_blank">32661668</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
