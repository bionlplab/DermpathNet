(A) Analysis of surgical tissue indicated that the milky-white tumor had invaded the lingual muscle from the mucosa. (B) SCC-infiltrated striated muscle bundles accompanied by round cell infiltration was visible (magnification, ×40; H&amp;E stain). (C) Lymphatic metastasis of SCC was observed at the level III neck region. No extranodal infiltration was detected (magnification, ×40; H&amp;E stain). (D) A small degree of spindle cell proliferation was observed under the ulcer (magnification, ×100; H&amp;E stain). (E) Atypical spindle cells with sarcomatous appearance had reached the dysplastic mucosal epithelium. SCC nests (arrow) were also observed (magnification, ×200; H&amp;E stain). SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; H&amp;E, hematoxylin and eosin.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28781811/" target="_blank">28781811</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
