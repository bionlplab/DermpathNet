(A) Staining against CTSB showed significant differences between lung SCC and adjacent normal tissues, and overexpression of CTSB was likely to present with bad differentiation. IHC (a: adjacent normal tissues; b: well differentiated, weakly positive; c: moderately differentiated, moderately positive; d: poorly differentiated, strongly positive.); H &amp; E (e: adjacent normal tissues; f: well differentiated; g: moderately differentiated; h: poorly differentiated). (B) Kaplan-Meier curves and statistics showed the correlation between CTSB expression and decreased survival. The 5-year survival rates were 41%, 20% and 2% for weak, moderate and strong staining samples, respectively, when CTSB was assessed as a marker (Statistical difference: weak VS moderate: P = 0.041; weak VS strong: P = 0.009; moderate VS strong: P = 0.021). Multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazard model also showed that CTSB could also be developed as a prognostic factor for lung SCC. (C) Patient data showed the 2-year metastatic rates were 9%, 21% and 44% for weak, moderate and strong staining samples; the 5-year metastatic rates were 27%, 41% and 71% for weak, moderate and strong staining samples, respectively, when CTSB was assessed as a marker. Therefore, CTSB expression might affect metastatic capacity of lung SCC.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24139065/" target="_blank">24139065</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
