Oral samples were normal oral mucosa (A-C), epithelial hyperplasia (D-F), low-grade OED (G-I), high-grade OED (J-O) and CIS (P-U). In normal oral mucosa and epithelial hyperplasia, YAP was weakly observed in the cell cytoplasm and nuclei of the basal and parabasal layers, and ΔNp63 was observed in the cell nuclei of the basal and parabasal layers (A-F). In low-grade OED, within the lower third of squamous epithelium, YAP expression was weakly distributed mainly in the cell cytoplasm, and ΔNp63 was observed in cell nuclei (G-I). In high-grade OED and CIS, YAP and ΔNp63 expression was mainly distributed up to the whole thickness of squamous epithelium (J-U). Strong YAP expression was observed in the cell cytoplasm (type C) or nuclei (type N) of neoplastic cells (K, N, Q, and T). Bars: 20 μm.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31217745/" target="_blank">31217745</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
