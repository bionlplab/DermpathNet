NANOG (C, brown) was expressed on the cytoplasm of cells within the TNs (arrows). Cells within the PTS did not express for NANOG (arrowheads). SOX2 (D, brown) was expressed on the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells within the TNs (arrows) and the PTS (arrowheads). KLF4 (E, brown) was present on the cytoplasm in cells throughout the TNs (arrow), and to a lesser extent, on cells within the PTS (arrowheads). c-MYC (F, brown) showed cytoplasmic and occasional nuclear expression on cells within the TNs (arrows) and cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in cells within the PTS (arrowheads). Nuclei were counter-stained with hematoxylin. Original magnification: 400x.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32850316/" target="_blank">32850316</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
