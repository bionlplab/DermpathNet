HMB45 positivity in atypical melanocytes that metastasized to the lymph node (HMB45, x200) (B). The patient underwent a combined wide local excision with negative margins and inguinal and parailiac lymph node dissection. The skin defect in the hip was reconstructed with a split skin graft. Pathologic examination demonstrated that the MM infiltrated into the entire dermis and metastasize into the lymph node. Two months later, magnetic resonance imaging showed soft tissue mass of 5x3.5x3 cm in size in the right pelvic region, considered conglomerate lymph nodes. The patient underwent surgery for this mass, and pathological examination revealed melanoma metastasis to the lymph node with extranodal soft tissue involvement. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, interferon, and radiotherapy. The patient died 12 months after the diagnosis of MM.Childhood MM is extremely uncommon, representing only 0.3%-0.4% of all melanomas in prepubertal children aged &lt;15 years (1). Depending on the size of the lesion, CMN carries an increased risk for the development of childhood melanoma. Giant CMNs (&gt;20 cm) have been reported to have increased risk of developing melanomas, particularly during the first and second decades of life (2). However, cutaneous melanomas rarely arise from small (â‰¤1 cm) and medium (1.5-20 cm) CMNs. Risk factors for developing melanoma from a CMN include irregular borders, increased diameter, color change, surface ulceration, and bleeding. Cutaneous MM poses a high risk of dissemination to regional lymph nodes and visceral organs. Childhood MM is a potentially fatal disease. Accurate staging of patients with melanoma is especially important if clinically occult systemic metastasis is present, which may preclude them the benefit of a complex lymph node dissection for locoregional control (1). The most appropriate imaging approach for diagnosing and following pediatric patients with MM has been adopted usually from adult guidelines because of its rarity (3). In staging melanoma, 18F-FDG PET/CT is often employed to evaluate distant metastatic disease, as melanoma is very 18F-FDG avid (3). In addition to staging, PET/CT plays an important role in patient management, such as deciding on the extent of surgery, determination of radiation field, and evaluation of treatment response. The current case also underlines the importance of whole-body oncologic assessment by 18F-FDG PET scan in pediatric MM, which is a rare but a serious clinical entity.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34082516/" target="_blank">34082516</a></p><p>Type: Benign, Category: Melanocytic</p>
