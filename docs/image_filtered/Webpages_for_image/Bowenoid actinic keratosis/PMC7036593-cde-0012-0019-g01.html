The nodule consists of three regions: a brownish, hyperkeratotic region (white arrow); a slightly dented, narrow, band-like region with a normal-looking skin surface (thin black arrow); a pinkish, glossy region (thick black arrow). b Cutting line of the resected tissue. Tissue sections were made according to the cutting line to include all three regions. c–g Histopathological findings. The specimen consists of four zones (A–D) (hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification ×20) (c). Histopathological findings of zones A and B correspond to the brownish, hyperkeratotic region. The epidermis of zone A shows hyperkeratosis (c), acanthosis composed of basaloid keratinocytes, and hyperpigmentation in the basal cell layer (d) (hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification ×200). The epidermis of zone B shows hyperkeratosis (c) and reticulated acanthosis composed of squamoid keratinocytes with pseudohorn cysts filled with keratin (e) (hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification ×200). Histopathological findings of zone C correspond to the dented, narrow, band-like region. The epidermis of this zone is atrophic and shows irregular buds extending to the dermis (hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification ×200) (f). Atypical cells are found in and directly above the basal cell layer. The atypical cells have large hyperchromatic nuclei. Prominent infiltration of inflammatory cells is present in the upper dermis just under the epidermis. Solar degeneration is present in the upper dermis (* in inset). Zone D, corresponding to the pinkish, glossy region, shows acanthotic epidermis, the entirety of which is occupied by atypical keratinocytes with a disorderly arrangement and atypical mitoses (hematoxylin and eosin, original magnification ×200) (g). Most of the epidermis shows parakeratosis. Severe infiltration of inflammatory cells is present just under the epidermis. In the upper dermis below the infiltrate of inflammatory cells, solar degeneration is evident (* in inset). Bars indicate 250 µm in (c) and 100 µm in (d–g), respectively.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32110205/" target="_blank">32110205</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Keratinocytic</p>
