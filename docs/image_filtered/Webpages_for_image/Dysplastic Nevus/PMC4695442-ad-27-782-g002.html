Lesional melanocytes did not show dysplasia (H&amp;E, ×100; left inset: ×400; right inset: clinical picture). (B) Histopathological picture of the atypical pigmented lesion showing elongated, fused rete ridges and contiguously distributed single melanocytes and a few small nests at the dermal-epidermal junction. In addition, eosinophilic fibroplasias and mild perivascular infiltrate were observed. Lesional melanocytes were observed to have moderately enlarged nuclei compared with most normal melanocytes and slightly irregular, hyperchromatic nuclei on the high-power field (×100; left inset: ×400; right inset: clinical picture). (C) Melan-A immunoreactivity of contiguously distributed melanocytes (×100). (D) HMB45 immunoreactivity of contiguously distributed melanocytes (×100).</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26719659/" target="_blank">26719659</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Melanocytic</p>
