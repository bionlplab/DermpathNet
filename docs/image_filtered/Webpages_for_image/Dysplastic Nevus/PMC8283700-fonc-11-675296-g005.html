(A–E) Man 52 years. Dermoscopy of a large pigmented lesion of the back with an irregular pigment network at the baseline (A) after one year, the lesion shows an increase in size with a homogeneous remodeling and a more prominent pigment network (B) such a slow clinical evolution is akin to a lentigo maligna of chronically sun-exposed skin and virtually excludes a diagnosis of nevus. Histopathologically, the tumor has a dysplastic nevus-like silhouette (C; hematoxylin–eosin, ×25) but is severely atypical because of the striking predominance of tightly packed single melanocytes at the junction (D; hematoxylin–eosin, ×100). PRAME immunostain shows a strong and diffuse nuclear positivity in intraepidermal melanocytes (E) ×250), as expected in melanoma. Clinicopathological features of the lesion are diagnostic for lentiginous melanoma in situ. (F–I) Man, 59 years. A large pigmented lesion of the abdomen, dermoscopically characterized by tiny eccentically grouped globules and structureless peripheral areas (F) after seven months the peripheral strucureless areas show a clear-cut increase in size (G). Histopathologically there are some areas with a dysplastic nevus-like silhouette, but the epidermis is largely atrophic (H; hematoxylin–eosin, ×25) and junctional nests are very large and irregular (I; hematoxylin–eosin, ×250). These features suggest a diagnosis of melanoma in situ with a focally “nested” architecture.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34277420/" target="_blank">34277420</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Melanocytic</p>
