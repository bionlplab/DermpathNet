Germinal center formation was present, with polarization and tingible body macrophages. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates were present in the interstitium. There were no areas of necrosis or mass lesions appreciated. b B cells predominately found in germinal centers were highlighted by CD20 positivity. c Increased scattered EBER–in situ hybridization-positive cells were seen as predominately small and stained.
