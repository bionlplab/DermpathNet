(A) Anastomosing epithelial strands extended down to the dermis and were composed of 2 different areas, i.e., dysplastic cells comprising almost the entire epidermis but not invading into the dermis and benign adenomatous lesion immediately surrounding the dysplastic keratinocytes in the lowermost portion of the epidermis (hematoxylin and eosin [H&amp;E], ×40). (B) Epithelial strands were surrounded by mucinous fibrous stroma, and small luminal ducts were embedded within the strands (H&amp;E, ×100). (C) Dysplastic area was composed of atypical cells with prominent nucleoli and abundant mitoses. Adjacent benign adenomatous portion was composed of oval and round cells (H&amp;E, ×200). (D) Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) was positive in the cytoplasm of dysplastic cells and weakly positive in the ductal structures in the adenomatous lesion (arrowheads) (EMA, ×40). (E) A p63 was positive in the nucleus of dysplastic cells and weakly positive in the adenoma lesion (p63, ×40). (F) Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) stain was weakly positive in the ductal structures in the adenoma lesion (arrowhead and inset on the right upper corner) (CEA, ×40).</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33911710/" target="_blank">33911710</a></p><p>Type: Benign, Category: Adnexal</p>
