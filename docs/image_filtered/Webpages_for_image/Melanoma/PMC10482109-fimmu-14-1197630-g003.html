(A) Representative images of immunohistochemistry analysis performed using antibodies directed against CD3 (panels a–c), CD8 (panels d–f), and CD25 (panels g–i), on normal skin biopsies and on biopsies from patients affected by vitiligo without melanoma (vitiligo) and who developed vitiligo during immunotherapy (vitiligo DI). Magnification 200x. (B) Quantitative analyses of immunohistochemical staining. Data are indicated as mean value + standard error of the mean (SEM), as assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37680638/" target="_blank">37680638</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Melanocytic</p>
