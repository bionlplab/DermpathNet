Some representative tumour images were photographed. Each insertion of magnified areas in the top right corner, highlighting some important figures. Arrows point to the areas of insertion. (A,B) Untreated (control) tumours demonstrated multiple cells undergoing mitosis, with no inflammation or necrosis. The magnified insertion of (A) shows cells with condensed chromatin, most likely in the prophase of mitosis. The magnified portion of (B) shows multiple cells with condensed chromatin, and two cells recently underwent mitosis. (C,D) Tumours treated one time during the initial treatment demonstrated cells undergoing mitosis, with some inflammatory cell infiltration. The magnified insertions of both (C,D) show cells with condensed chromatin. (E,F) Tumours treated weekly for 4 weeks demonstrated very few cells undergoing mitosis. The magnified insertion portion of (E) shows white cell infiltration around necrotic tissue, while the magnified insertion of (F) highlights necrotic tissue. (G,H) Tumours treated twice a week for 4 weeks showed significant white cell infiltration and some necrosis. In the magnified portion of (G), some necrotic tissue with cellular infiltrate is present, while the magnified portion of (H) shows cellular infiltration. (I,J) Tumours treated daily showed significant necrosis and white cell infiltration. The infiltration around blood vessels can be seen in the magnified portion of (I), while the infiltration in necrotic tissue is highlighted in (J).</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33531565/" target="_blank">33531565</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Melanocytic</p>
