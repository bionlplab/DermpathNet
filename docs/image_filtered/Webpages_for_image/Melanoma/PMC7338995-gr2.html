BRAFVE melanomas are highly vascular and consist primarily of short spindle cells exhibiting high-grade nuclear features and prominent nucleoli. They invade into subcutaneous fat, muscle, and cartilage. IHC for S100 demonstrated the melanocytic origin of the tumors. IHC for P-ERK demonstrated canonical MAPK pathway activation. Assessment of the Ki67 cellular proliferation marker was performed using IHC on slides with uniform tumor cellularity and results demonstrated that all of the tumors were highly proliferative. IHC sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and a hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained tumor section is provided for comparison.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32629178/" target="_blank">32629178</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Melanocytic</p>
