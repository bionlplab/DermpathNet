Representative images of cells stained with H&amp;E (left) and the mean of migrated and invaded cells (right) were shown. Data were shown for the mean Â± SD from three independent experiments. *, P &lt; 0.05. (C1) Representative images of the lungs harvested from mice injected with vector control cells and A375 IGFBP5 OE cells were shown. (C2) The mean number of metastatic lung clusters from mice control and A375 IGFBP5 OE tumors were plotted, as analyzed by H&amp;E staining. *, P &lt; 0.05. (D1 and D2) H&amp;E staining of lung tumor sections and adjacent tissues from control and IGFBP5 OE mice. Representative images of the harvested lungs from injected mice were shown for each treatment.
