Patients of the metastatic group had distant organ metastases in the lung, liver, brain, bones, skin and lymph nodes. A. Relative expression of CCL8 in clinical samples was measured by real time PCR and significant differences were detected between non-metastatic and lung metastatic primary human melanomas, the latter expressing lower quantities of CCL8. B. There was no difference in CCR1 expression level between the two groups (lung metastatic vs. non-metastatic). C. Heterogeneous expression of CCL8 protein was detected in the human melanoma primary tumor samples by immunohistochemistry (magnification: 20x). D. Systemic appearance of CCL8 in serum of melanoma patients was analyzed by ELISA kit. Thirty-six samples were analyzed and CCL8 protein was detected. Differences found between metastatic and non-metastatic samples were not stasistically significant, because deviation of the datas.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26320180/" target="_blank">26320180</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Melanocytic</p>
