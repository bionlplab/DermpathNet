(A) Dermoscopy showing peripheral streaks and black blotch in the center of the lesion. (B) Histologically, large junctional nests were a prominent feature, and some nests were parallel to the epidermis. A large amount of melanophages was present in the dermis below the lesion (H&amp;E, 4×). The rectangular area is magnified in C. (C) Cells are large, spindle-shaped in the nest (left side) and epithelioid in the lentiginous component of the lesion (right side) (H&amp;E, 40×). (D) In some fields, a continuous lentiginous pattern of growth and some pagetoid elements were evident (H&amp;E, 20×). The diagnosis was changed from Spitz nevus to malignant melanoma with spitzoid features. H&amp;E, hematoxylin and eosin.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33614670/" target="_blank">33614670</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Melanocytic</p>
