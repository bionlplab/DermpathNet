In the figure untreated (0) and 1-day (1), 2-day (2), 3-day (3), 4-day (4), 5-day (5) treated sections are shown. A0-5) In the feline sample, after a 24-h photobleaching treatment, neoplastic cells were completely depigmented and no differences were noted for longer treatments; in all treated sections, cell morphology was well maintained. B0-5) In the canine sample, a 24-h treatment resulted in a considerable melanin degradation; still, single or aggregated neoplastic melanocytes, either totally black or characterized by a black-brownish cytoplasm, were observed; following a 2-days treatment, neoplastic cells were entirely depigmented and no further changes were noted in the 3-, 4- and 5-days treatments. In all treated sections, cell morphology was well maintained. C0-5) In the equine sample after a 24-h treatment, a considerable part of the section was still pigmented, with melanocytes characterized by a totally black cytoplasm or variable numbers of intracytoplasmic round black granules; after a 2-days treatment, occasional melanocytes with intracytoplasmic granules were still present; melanin was not observed in the 3-, 4- and 5-days treated sections. In all treated sections, cell morphology was well maintained. D0-5) In the swine sample, pigmented cells were completely bleached after a 24-h treatment; no changes were observed following longer treatments; in all treated sections, cell morphology was well maintained.
