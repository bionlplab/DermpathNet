WM115F cells grown under normoxic conditions were used as control. The mice were followed for 45 days and then sacrificed. All mice that received hypoxia treated melanoma cell developed tumors, while 3 of 4 mice that received 100 normoxic cells developed tumors. (a) Left side: representative xenograft formed by 100 melanoma cells cultured under normoxic conditions. Right side: representative xenograft formed by 100 melanoma cells cultured under hypoxia. (b) 106 of hypoxia-treated melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously, the same number of melanoma cells grown under normoxia were used as controls. H&amp;E staining of a representative xenograft formed by normoxia-treated melanoma cells reveals extensive necrosis in the tumor (Arrow points to areas with tumor necrosis) (25x). (c) H&amp;E staining of a xenograft tumor formed by hypoxia-treated melanoma cells reveals significantly less tumor necrosis. (d-f) Histology of spontaneous metastases developed by hypoxic melanoma cells: lung metastasis (d, 400x); lymphovascular invasion (e, 400x); pancreas metastasis (f, 100x). (g) Tumor volume. Hypoxia-treated melanoma cells form significantly larger tumors than melanoma cells grown under normoxic conditions. * indicates p&lt;0.01.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29383148/" target="_blank">29383148</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Melanocytic</p>
