(A) Micro signet-ring cell carcinomatous lesion, in which multiple signet-ring cells were close to each other tightly, and were basically friendly toward surrounding normal glands, without mutual aggression. The cytoplasm on the cell was lightly eosinaceous, the envelope area was deeply stained, ringed, and about 70% of the cells were without nucleus. HE ×400. (B) Gastric foveolar-type signet-ring cell carcinoma, which also showed horizontal growth in gastric foveal area selectively. It grew slowly and by creeping into the interstitial area of the gastric fovea, and was basically friendly towards surrounding normal glands, without mutual aggression. HE ×100. (C) Undifferentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell differentiation, refers to the tumor formed by a mixture of undifferentiated cancer cells and signet-ring cells. Undifferentiated cancer cells had small volume, irregular small round shape, oval shape, less cytoplasm, a very big proportion between nucleus and cytoplasm, bare nucleus-like, and slightly basophilic staining. Signet-ring carcinoma cells accounted for 20%~80% of the tumor. HE ×200. (D) Mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell differentiation, consists of signet-ring carcinoma and mucous tissues in terms of tumor histology. Signet-ring carcinoma cells accounted for 20%~80% of the tumor. HE ×200. (E) Adenoid adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell differentiation, consists of signet-ring carcinoma and adenocarcinoma tissues, HE ×200. (F) Fundus gland adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell differentiation, consists of signet-ring carcinoma and fundus gland adenocarcinoma tissues. Fundus gland adenocarcinoma tissues showed irregular tubular and branching structures, with less stroma. HE ×200.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37483506/" target="_blank">37483506</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Adnexal</p>
