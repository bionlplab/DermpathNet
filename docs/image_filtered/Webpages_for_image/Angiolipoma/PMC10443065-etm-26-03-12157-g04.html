(A) The evaluation revealed a large fibrous stroma, a connective tissue framework, encapsulating fatty tissue. Of note, this fatty tissue did not exhibit any signs of atypia, suggesting the absence of abnormal or dysplastic cells. Within this fatty tissue, a significant proliferation of capillaries was observed, indicating an active blood supply to the area (arrow). (B) These capillaries were found to contain fibrin thrombi (arrow), clots formed by fibrin proteins, and exhibited fibrofatty changes. These changes typically involve the replacement or transformation of normal tissue structures with fibrous and fatty tissues. The image provides a detailed visual representation of these pathological findings (haematoxylin and eosin stain; magnification, x100; scale bars, 100 µm).</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37614439/" target="_blank">37614439</a></p><p>Type: Benign, Category: Adipocytic</p>
