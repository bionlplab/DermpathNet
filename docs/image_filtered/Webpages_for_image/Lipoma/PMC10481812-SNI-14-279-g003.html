(b) Sagittal view of T1WI at the age of 2 months, (c and d) sagittal views of 3D-hT2WI (c) and T1WI (d) at the age of 7 months. Each level of the vertebral columns from L3 to S5 is indicated on (b) and (c). and (e-i) Schematic drawings (e-g and i) and microscopic view (h) of the operative findings. (j) The electrophysiological border between functional conus and caudal lipoma was determined with IONM, by tracing the evoked compound muscle potentials of the external anal sphincter with stimulation of 2 mA, beginning from the functional conus (g-(1)(2)(3)), and proceeding to the caudal lipoma (g-(4)(5)(6)). Stimulation sites are indicated on (g). Each histopathology section is shown in red characters “l-o, p/q”. (k) Sagittal view of postoperative 3D-hT2WI. (l-o) Photomicrographic composite of the vertical view of the skin and epidural stalk, stained with H&amp;E (l and n) and immunostained for GFAP (m and o). CC-LELL with NGT is surrounded by blue arrows on (m), (l), (p), and (q). The location of CC-LELL with NGT surrounded by neuroglial tissue in the epidural stalk is indicated as * in (j). The sites surrounded by dotted line in (l and m) indicate the same site. Higher magnification views of the area indicated by the square in (l) are shown in (n and o), respectively. (p and q) Photomicrograph of the cyst wall in the lipoma stained with H&amp;E (p) and immunostained for GFAP (q). The location of each section is indicated as l-o and p, q in (j). T1WI: T1-weighted image, 3D-hT2WI: three-dimensional heavily T2-weighted image, IONM: Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, H&amp;E: hematoxylin and eosin, CC-LELL, central canal-like ependyma-lined lumen; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein, FAT: fibroadipose tissue, FCT: fibrocollagenous tissue, cc: central canal-like structure, and Epen: ependymal cells.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37680925/" target="_blank">37680925</a></p><p>Type: Benign, Category: Adipocytic</p>
