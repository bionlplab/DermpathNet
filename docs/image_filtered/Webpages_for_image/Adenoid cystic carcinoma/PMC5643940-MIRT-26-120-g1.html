The ultrasound examination revealed a gross mass adjacent to the thyroid gland and she underwent total excision of the mass along with total thyroidectomy. Histopathologic examination of the 9.5x10 cm mass revealed adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) infiltrating both the thyroid and adjacent smooth muscle tissue. (A, B): Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of the primary tumor: Tumor cells were arranged in cord-like or acinar-like by atypical hyperplastic epithelial cells forming a cribriform and tubular pattern with a mucoid luminal material (x40). (C, D): Tumor cells were negative for thyroglobulin (C) and TTF-1 (D) excluding thyroid origin (x40). Tumor cells were immune-positive for CD-117 (E) indicating ductal origin and E-cadherin (F) (x100). She was accepted as ACC of the head and neck region. The patient was referred to FDG PET/CT scanning for initial staging. PET/CT images revealed multiple hypermetabolic lung metastasis and a mild FDG uptake in the operation region secondary to surgery. She received radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and was stable for about 20 months follow-up</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28976335/" target="_blank">28976335</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Adnexal</p>
