(A) Immunohistochemical staining of CD4 (brown) and CD45 (data not shown) was performed on paraffin embedded NB tumor tissue at diagnostic biopsy from MYCN amplified high-risk, MYCN non-amplified high-risk, MYCN non-amplified intermediate, and MYCN non-amplified low-risk tumors. The nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin (blue). Tissue sections were imaged at ×100 original magnification. The association between CD4, CD45 expression, and MYCN amplification (B) and risk stratification (C) was determined by digital mean density image analysis and the data are graphed. P-values in (C) were calculated with an unpaired Mann–Whitney test.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29163537/" target="_blank">29163537</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Neural or neuroendocrine</p>
