CD57high and CD57low tumor cells were isolated by FACS from one primary orthotopic tumor. 1×104 cells were surgically transplanted into the left adrenal glands of immunodeficient mice (8 animals per group). The development of tumors was monitored by palpation and verified by necropsy when mice had to be killed because of excessively large tumors or when the experiment was terminated at 90 days. The log rank test was used for statistical analysis. The experiment was repeated twice, with similar results. (B) Orthotopic U-NB1 tumors are stroma-poor. Tumors were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and HE-stained. Scale bar equals 200 µm.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22900004/" target="_blank">22900004</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Neural or neuroendocrine</p>
