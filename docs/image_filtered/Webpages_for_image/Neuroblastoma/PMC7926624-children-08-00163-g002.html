(A) H&amp;E staining of primary tumor shows histomorphological characteristics of poorly differentiated, Schwannian stroma poor neuroblastoma; (B) aquaporin 1 (AQP1) immunohistochemical staining and hematoxylin counterstaining of the liver metastases reveals dissolution of the periportal structure in the tumor-infiltrated regions. AQP1 positivity is observed in metastatic areas as well as in vascular endothelium (which can serve as an internal positive control). (C) AQP1, CXCR4 and MAP2 (microtubule associated protein) immunofluorescence staining of the primary tumor. Nuclei staining with DAPI (4â€²,6-diamidin-2-phenylindol). Next to AQP1, which is expressed in vascular structures as well as specific tumor areas, there is some expression of CXCR4 as a marker for metastatic homing as well as MAP2 expression in some areas indicating a more mature neuronal phenotype. Overall, tumor and metastases express experimental features that can be associated with a more aggressive phenotype.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33671521/" target="_blank">33671521</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Neural or neuroendocrine</p>
