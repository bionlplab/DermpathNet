Clinical and dermoscopic presentation: dermoscopic images were taken from the lesion on which biopsy was done. The lesion was on the brachial region of the patient. Along with typical dermoscopic presentation of MF on other parts of the body, on selected body parts, lesions presented with follicular accentuation and with follicular plugging. Follicular accentuation and plugging were more visible when higher magnification was used. Clinical staging of the patients at the time of evaluation was T2N0M0B0. (A) Clinical presentation of lesion from where the biopsy was taken. (B–C) Dermoscopy of the lesion from where the biopsy was taken. (D) Dermoscopy of the skin from the presternal area. (E–H) Histologic presentation of the lesion from where the biopsy was done. (E) Follicular and ecrrine gland involvement by dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes (H&amp;E, ×4). (F) Marked folliculotropism, peri- and intrafolllicular lymphoid infiltration with mucin deposition (H&amp;E, ×10). (G) Syringometaplastic structures of eccrine glands surrounded and infiltrated by atypical lymphocytes (H&amp;E, ×20). (H) Immunohistochemical staining was positive for T lymphocytes (CD4; ×4) (I) Lymphocytic infiltrate was composed of CD3+ lymphocytes (×4). Clinical photography was taken with a Canon Powershot SX520 HS and the dermoscopic image with a Nikon/DermLite Photo.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33150017/" target="_blank">33150017</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Hematolymphoid</p>
