Clinical and dermoscopic presentation of the lesion on the face. In this patient follicular accentuation is less visible, follicular obliteration and plugging are more pronounced, and bluish, not well-defined areas are seen Clinical staging of the patients at the time of evaluation was T4N2M0B0. (A) Clinical presentation of the lesion from where biopsy was taken. (B–D) Dermoscopic appearance of the lesion from where the biopsy was taken. Dermoscopy shows obliteration of the follicles and in some parts bluish, not well -defined structures where eccrine involvment was found. (E–H) Histology of the lesion from where biopsy was taken. (E) Atypical lymphocytes surround and invade follicular epithelium (H&amp;E, ×10). (F) Atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD3+ on immunohistochemistry (×10). (G) CD3+ lymphocytes have a predilection for eccrine ducts (×20). (H) Infiltration of eccrine ducts with atypical small to medium-sized lymphocytes (H&amp;E, ×20). Clinical photography was taken with a Canon Powershot SX520 HS and the dermoscopic image with a Nikon/DermLite Photo.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33150017/" target="_blank">33150017</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Hematolymphoid</p>
