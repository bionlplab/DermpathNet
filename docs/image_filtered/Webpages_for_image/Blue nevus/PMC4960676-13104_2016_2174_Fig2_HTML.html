The covering non-disordered epidermis exhibited attenuated and atrophic change with absence of rete ridge. Bar  2 mm. b On high-power view (H&amp;E stains), these aggregated round to oval cells contained bland-looking small nuclei and abundant melanin-pigmented cytoplasm. In addition, immunohistochemically, these melanophages were strongly positive for CD68 (inset). Bar  50 μm. c In these fibrotic dermis, reactive vascular networks were noted, associated with mild interstitial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Furthermore the peripheral epidermis displayed exocytosis of focal nested lymphocytes (inset). Bar  500 μm. d In immunohistochemistry, dermal infiltrating CD8-positive T-lymphocytes (right) were markedly larger than CD4-positive T-lymphocytes (left) in number in this cutaneous lesion.
