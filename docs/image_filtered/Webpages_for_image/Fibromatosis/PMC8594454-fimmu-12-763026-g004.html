(A–F): Gingival samples were stained with rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody to hBD-2 (1:300) using standard IHC protocol; Circled areas in (A) was amplified in (B) and (C); (D) was amplified in (E) and (F); (A–C) were derived from patient with NHGF; (D–F) were derived from a healthy control gingival biopsy; (C) hBD-2 was detected in the cytoplasm; Arrows indicate positive staining. (G–L): Gingival samples were stained with rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody to hBD-3 (1:400) using standard IHC protocol; Circled areas in (G) was amplified in (H, I); (J) was amplified in (K, L); (G–I) were derived from patient with NHGF; (J–L) were derived from a healthy control gingival biopsy; (I) hBD-3 was detected in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Arrows indicate positive staining.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34795673/" target="_blank">34795673</a></p><p>Type: Benign, Category: Fibrohistiocytic</p>
