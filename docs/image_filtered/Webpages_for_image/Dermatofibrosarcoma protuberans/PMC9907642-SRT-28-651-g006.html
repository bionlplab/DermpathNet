The patient complained of a new mass that grew rapidly during 2 years. (A) Macro‐examinations showed that the mass was translucent with a firm texture. (B–D) The mass was presented iso‐intensity in T1WI (B) and inhomogeneous hyperintensity in T2WI (C), and an annular with hypo‐intensity T2 signal (capsule) could be observed. The tumor grew beyond the capsule. The mass appeared with a significant and inhomogeneous enhancement pattern in fat‐suppression (FS)‐T1WI (D), while multiple tiny spinal protrusions infiltrating adjacent subcutaneous fat layer could be clearly visualized (arrows in D). (E) Time‐signal intensity curve (TIC) of the oval ROI in “D” was type‐III TIC. (F) Dense spindle cells were arranged in a fascicular pattern, and a frequent mitosis could be observed (hematoxylin‐eosin, H&amp;E, x100). (G) The region in the square (D) showed degenerative sarcoma cells and abundant blood vessels. (H) The tumor cells infiltrated into the subcutaneous fat tissue in a honeycomb pattern (H&amp;E, x100)</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35639715/" target="_blank">35639715</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Fibrohistiocytic</p>
