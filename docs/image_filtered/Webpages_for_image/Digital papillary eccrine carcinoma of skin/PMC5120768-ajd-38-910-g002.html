B, The tumor consisted of discrete nodules that were well circumscribed and, as was the case with the previous specimen, the tumor contained hemorrhages, although there were fewer tubular structures than in the previous specimen (hematoxylin and eosin ×20). C, Neoplastic cells exhibit nuclear atypicality and an increased number of mitoses compared with the previous specimen (hematoxylin and eosin ×400). D, Distinctive squamous foci were present (hematoxylin and eosin ×400). E, p63 staining showing that tumor cells, with the exception of those lining the tubular structures, were positive for p63 expression (×100).</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27870729/" target="_blank">27870729</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Adnexal</p>
