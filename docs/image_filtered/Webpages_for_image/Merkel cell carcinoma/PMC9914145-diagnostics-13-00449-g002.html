(B,C) However, an incisional biopsy of the cutaneous tumor showed only well-differentiated SCC ((B), ×20), formed by polygonal squamous epithelial cells with keratinization ((C), ×100). (D–F) With the presentation of metastatic nodal NEC suggestive of MCC, one of us (S.-S.C.) urged the clinician for an excisional biopsy, which showed a well-differentiated SCC on the surface (right-hand side; (D)) and MCC in the deeper part (left-hand side; ×40). A higher magnification of the MCC component disclosed solid nests of monotonous neoplastic cells with a fine chromatin pattern and frequent mitoses (E), as well as immunoreactivity for synaptophysin (F). ((E,F), ×400). Immunohistochemically, the non-SCC tumor cells also expressed CK20, INSM1, and TTF-1 (clone SP141), confirming the diagnosis of combined MCC and SCC. The tumor cells were negative for Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) large T antigen (clone CM2B4, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The patient received reduced-dose combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide because of his old age. Unfortunately, the patient passed away after undergoing chemotherapy due to a progressive disease within two months.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36766554/" target="_blank">36766554</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Neural or neuroendocrine</p>
