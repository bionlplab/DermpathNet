(PDX) at each passage. Tumor nodules were fixed in
formalin-containing bottles, and tumor sections were prepared on slides. The slides
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) solution, as described in the
Materials and Methods section. All sections containing tumor tissue were
microscopically examined, and representative images at each passage are shown (upper
panels). The expression of Caldesmon (CALD, CDM), M-actin, and smooth muscle actin
(SMA) in tumors collected from recipient mice engrafted with PDX were measured using
immunohistochemical staining. Staining for SMA is shown at each passage (lower
panels). The black bar indicates 100 μm for sections stained with H&amp;E, whereas
the white bar indicates 50 μm for sections stained with SMA.</p> <p>PMID: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33627948/" target="_blank">33627948</a></p><p>Type: Premalignant/Malignant, Category: Smooth muscle</p>
