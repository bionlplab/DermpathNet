            <h3>Overview</h3>
            Welcome to DermpathNet! DermpathNet is an ongoing research effort to curate open-source peer-reviewed diagnoses-based dermatopathology images from PubMed Central Â® <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">(PMC)</a> as a central repository for dermatologists, pathologists, and trainees.

            <h3>What is DermpathNet?</h3>
            <p>DermpathNet is an encyclopedia hosting over 7,000 images and 100 diagnoses spanning common and rare benign and malignant cutaneous neoplasms. All images are curated from PMC using an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered workflow and secondarily inspected by experts. All images hosted are peer-reviewed and open-access and can be used for research or teaching. Images are organized according to the ontologic hierarchy of the corresponding diagnoses, and the website also features a search bar for rapid retrieval of a particular diagnosis. </p>

            <h3>Why DermpathNet? </h3>
            <p>Accessing high-quality open-access dermatopathology image databases for learning and cross-referencing poses a common challenge for clinicians and dermatopathology trainees. While existing platforms like VisualDx offer collections, they often require subscriptions which limit accessibility. 

                Here, we employed an AI-enabled workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) database, covering over 100 benign and malignant cutaneous neoplasms. We have established a comprehensive dermatopathology database for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes. All images hosted on the website have been peer-reviewed and annotated according to the corresponding figure legends in the manuscript.  </p>

            <h3>Does ImageNet own the images? Can I download the images?</h3>
            <p>No, ImageNet does not own the copyright of the images. The images are open-access and hosted by PMC and can be downloaded for research and education purposes. </p>
