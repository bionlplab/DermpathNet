PMC4318070,Figure 3,"A low magnification view (a) of the biopsy specimen from the nasal dorsum shows a plaque-like proliferation of cells, which are present in the mid and deep reticular dermis. Closer view (b) abundant mucin between the bundles of cells. The high magnification view (c) the cells have blunt-tipped, cigar-shaped nuclei without atypia or mitoses. These findings are suggestive of a pilar leiomyoma (H and E, a = ×2, b = ×4, c = ×20)",IJD-60-82-g003
