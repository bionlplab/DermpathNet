PMC9576078,Fig 2,"Histopathologic changes in the affected Chinese shar-pei.(A and B) The epidermis is severely hyperplastic with extensive compact and lamellar hyperkeratosis of the surface. The hyperkeratosis extends into the follicular lumina dilating the follicular openings (H&E; 40x). (C) There is a prominent granular layer with irregularly sized keratohyalin granules and common perinuclear vacuoles (H&E; 400x). (D) Multifocally, there were neutrophilic crusts indicating secondary pyoderma.",pone.0275367.g002,NotMatch,Match

A deletion of one copy of the allele is visible in the case but not in the parents. Note that in the IGV screenshot bases 2,422,713–2,422,715 are deleted, whereas the 3’-rule of HGVS nomenclature requires to designate this variant as Chr27:2,422,716_2,422,718del (CanFam3.1). (B) Schematic representation of the protein domain structure of a keratin dimer [20] with the highly conserved amino acid sequence of the coil 1A subdomain shown below. The variant is predicted to delete an asparagine residue from coil 1A, which is located within the rod domain of KRT1.",pone.0275367.g003,NotMatch,NotMatch
