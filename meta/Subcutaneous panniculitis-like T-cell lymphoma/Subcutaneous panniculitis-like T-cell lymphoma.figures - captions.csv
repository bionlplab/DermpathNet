(A) The dot-plots of FCI from the lymph node fine-needle aspiration sample. (B) The dot-plots of FCI from the bone marrow aspiration sample from the same patient. In these dot-plots, the abnormal T cells (dark blue dots) show bright CD45, moderate CD5, bright CD2, moderate CD4, partial CD10, bright CD279 (PD1), and moderate CD185 (CXCR5) expressions but aberrant loss of surface CD3 and CD7 expressions. The orange dots represent normal T cells, and light blue dots show polyclonal B cells. (C) Microscopic pictures of histological (H&E staining) and immunohistochemistry results from the lymph node biopsy demonstrating B cell [highlighted by CD20 and PAX5 immunohistochemistry (IHC)] and plasma cell hyperplasia (highlighted by CD138 IHC). T cells were highlighted by CD5, CD7, CD3, CD4, and CD8 IHC.",fonc-12-779230-g003
