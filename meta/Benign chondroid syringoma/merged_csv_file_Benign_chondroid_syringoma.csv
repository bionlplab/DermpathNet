The transition from BCS to MCS (c) is evident on the left of this field, while a closer view of the carcinomatous areas (d) declares solid sheets of atypical epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and brisk mitotic activity. There is a relatively abrupt transition between the carcinomatous component and adjacent sarcomatous foci (e), with the latter comprising pleomorphic, hyperchromatic spindled and larger plump cells set within a richly vascular background of myxoid stroma (f). g Numerous vacuolated lipoblasts with scalloped, hyperchromatic nuclei characterise the associated liposarcomatous component.",dpa-0006-0077-g01

The more solid white protuberant area corresponds to a benign chondroid syringoma (BCS) component, which is characterised microscopically by bland epithelial cords enveloping keratinous cysts (b), banal tubular structures, and an associated chondromyxoid stroma (c). d Low-power examination reveals a residual BCS in the upper part of the field, which is somewhat overshadowed by an adjacent malignant neoplasm showing areas of necrosis and dystrophic calcification. There is clear transition from a precursor BCS to spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (e, f), with the latter comprising haphazardly arranged fascicles of pleomorphic, mitotically active spindled cells (f, g) exhibiting focal pancytokeratin (MNF116) immunoreactivity (h, inset). The sarcomatoid SCC in turn gives way to an osteosarcomatous component (i), with seams of eosinophilic osteoid material flanked by pleomorphic hyperchromatic cells, including multinucleate forms.",dpa-0006-0077-g02
