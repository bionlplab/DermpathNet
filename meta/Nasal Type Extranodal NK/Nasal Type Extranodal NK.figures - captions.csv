On the other hand, down-regulated AKT causes p53 activated. By inducing DDR directly or via increasing Zta of EBV, RSV phosphorylates ATM, Chk2 and p53, subsequently inhibits Cyclin A2, which leads to S phase cell cycle arrest. p53 can also up-regulate Bax and Bad and activate caspase cascade, which ultimately leads to apoptosis",13046_2017_601_Fig7_HTML

Anti-PD1 antibodies, such as Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, target microenvironment T-cells that become inactivated when bound with Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on tumor cells, inducing anergy. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is a transmembrane protein produced by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), which subsequently activates the NF-κB pathway and leads to cell proliferation and lymphomagenesis. This in turn upregulates PD-L1, which makes immune checkpoint blockade an attractive target.

PMC7073055,Figure 1,"Pathogenetic mechanisms in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL). (a) LMP-1, a member of the TNF receptor family, is constitutively activated and leads to ligand-independent activation of NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). LMP1/EBNA2 viral proteins transcriptionally target c-myc and activate NF-kB, which translocates into the nucleus and regulates MYC to induce proliferation and activate survivin. They also increase the sensitivity of the infected cell to IL-2, which promotes growth. LMP-1 upregulates PD-L1, which is postulated to occur through the MAPK/NF-kB pathway. (b) LCK/ZAP70: the kinase LCK is activated after major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide binding, or presumably by genetic alteration, and can then phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), leading to the recruitment of the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP70. Lymphocyte-cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (LCK) activation can also lead to autophosphorylation of ZAP70, which in turn activates the LAT and SLP-76 and the PLC-γ and MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. The recruitment and activation of LAT and its subsequent recruitment of several molecules such as GRAP2 and ITK, modulate T-cell transcriptional regulation and gene expression related to survival, apoptosis, proliferation, and migration of T-cells. Docking protein 2 (DOK2) can impart negative feedback on NK-cell activation with presumed inhibition of ZAP-70. LCK activation also leads to the phosphorylation and activation of ITK. (c) JAK/STAT and EZH2: JAK/STAT represents a pro-proliferative signaling pathway, mutations in which can cause constitutive activation in ENKTL. JAK3 and STAT3 phosphorylation have been reported to occur in a majority of tested ENKTL cases and can also cause presumed activation of this pathway. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase and part of the PRC2 complex and is involved in epigenetic regulation. Phosphorylation of EZH2 by JAK3 can initiate dissociation of PRC2 which leads to decreased H3K27me3 levels and confers EZH2 independent activity as a transcriptional coactivator for genes involved in DNA replication and tumor invasion.

The threshold probability represented the 3-year risk of mortality by any cause based on each prognostic model for recommending clinical intervention. The threshold defines the weight w for false-positive (FP, treat while patient survived) vs. true-positive (TP, treat a patient who died) classifications. The net benefit (NB) balanced the risk of real 3-year mortality with the potential harms of unnecessary intervention (including decision of treatment, work-up, or follow-up) for false prediction and was calculated as the true-positive rate minus the weighted false-positive rate. The clinical usefulness of a prediction model can be summarized as: NB = (TP − w FP)/N, where N is the total number of patients. Solid black line: Assume no patients need receive clinical intervention (no patients died), net benefit is zero (no true-positive and no false-positive classification). Gray line: Assume all patients need receive clinical intervention (all died). Dotted color lines: Patients received clinical intervention if predictions exceeded a threshold, with 3-year mortality risk predictions based on different prognostic models.

PMC8650233,Fig. 1,"Flow diagram of the procedure. First, from the peripheral blood of a pair of twins, we applied a whole-genome shotgun (WGS, Beijing Boao Biological Co., Ltd) for sequencing to identify unique variant genes. One individual is diagnosed with ENKTL, while the other is healthy. Next, we downloaded a training dataset (GSE 80632) and testing database (GSE 19067) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/). Subsequently, we conducted the Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA) and z score normalization to preprocess the data. To understand the biological function of unique mutated genes, GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment analysis and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis were performed in DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). R package goplot was used for visualization. Then, to select unique genes, we used an elastic net to fit a generalized linear model by the R package glmnet and analyzed the training dataset by using the elastic net. Simultaneously, we used another algorithm called Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) to identify unique genes. Nest, to explore pathway gene sets of selected markers, we conducted GSEA and GSVA of the training set data. We performed GSEA with GSEA V4.1.0 software. Correspondingly, GSVA relied on R package “GSVA”. We conducted single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to achieve enrichment scores of immune-filtrating cells by calculating enrichment scores. Also, we performed Spearman correlation tests to assess correlation and used R package pheatmap for visualization. Fianally, to validate the reliability and accuracy of unique genes, the validation set was used to verify the expression of the screened markers. For differential genes, we used Boxvolin plots to demonstrate their expression levels. Created with BioRender.com",12885_2021_9023_Fig1_HTML

CD27 contributes to anti-tumor cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte response in the host, T-cell exhaustion, compromise in antitumor immunity. In addition, EBV LMP1 and upregulation of IFNγ and IL6_JAK_STAT3 could also contribute to PDL1 overexpression in PTCL-EBV.

Administration of Asp hydrolyzes serum asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia (NH3), thereby inhibiting tumor cell protein synthesis and ultimately leading to tumor cell death. In contrast, all normal cells in the body have two pathways to obtain L-asparagine for protein synthesis: taking extracellular L-asparagine from the circulation (pathway ①) and synthesizing their own L-asparagine from aspartic acid and NH3 via AsnS (pathway ②).

F Chiauranib can eliminate NKTL growth by triggering AIF-dependent apoptosis. The release of AIF from mitochondria is due to (1) mitochondrial m-calpain activation truncates VDAC in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and cleavage of VDAC promotes the release of AIF from mitochondria. (2) The AKT-GSK3β signaling pathway was triggered to potentiate VDAC1 phosphorylation, which contributes to the stability of VDAC1, therefore, allowing AIF to enter the nucleus and induce DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Meanwhile, lack of BAX expression in NKTL leads to the inability to induce mitochondrial cyt-C released apoptosis. L-asparaginase triggered CD95(Fas/Apo-1)-caspase 8-caspase 3 apoptotic pathway in NKTL cells, and the combination of Chiauranib and L-asparaginase exhibited a synergistic effect, suggesting the feasibility of combining these two drugs for effective treatment of NKTL.",41419_2023_5833_Fig8_HTML
