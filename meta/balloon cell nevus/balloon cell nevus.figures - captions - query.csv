PMC7109564,Fig 1,BCC-IDN collision in which balloon cells mimicked melanoma. Dermoscopy shows arborizing vessels (black arrows). Inset shows the clinical image of a 6-mm shiny pink papule on the chest with slightly rolled borders.,gr1,NotMatch,NotMatch
PMC7109564,Fig 2,BCC-IDN collision in which balloon cells mimicked melanoma: RCM images (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm) show (A) a lobulated BCC tumor island (red asterisk) with peritumoral dark spaces colliding with the nonhomogenous round bright nucleated melanocytic cells (yellow arrows) in the dermis and (B) large pleomorphic nucleated cells (yellow arrows) with abundant bright cytoplasm (yellow arrows) that appears within the epidermis (yellow asterisk) concerning for pagetoid cells of melanoma.,gr2,NotMatch,NotMatch
PMC7109564,Fig 3,BCC-IDN collision in which balloon cells mimicked melanoma. Histopathology findings show melanocytes with balloon cell change (arrows) beneath the flattened epidermis and overlying the lobule of BCC (red asterisk).

PMC3791969,Figure 2,Dermatoscopic image of the skin lesion indicated by the arrow in Figure 1. Three terminal hairs protrude from a structureless yellow lesion. Structureless red centrally is evidence of ulceration as is a single thread of adherent fibre (inferior central). A few small curved and dot vessels are seen inferior to the central structureless red area but are not considered sufficient to be a clue to the specific diagnosis.
