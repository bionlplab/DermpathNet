Ideally, wounds will heal fully, but scars may persist for many years or the life of the individual (dashed lines). Infarct scar formation begins with removal of dead cells (not shown) and is followed by similar phases of inflammation, proliferation, and scar formation/remodeling. Unlike in wound healing, myofibroblasts may persist in the scar for years, leading to long-term remodeling. In interstitial cardiac fibrosis, the precise timing of the initiating event may be impossible to determine, and the phases of cell proliferation and ECM remodeling may continue over spans of years.

It is unclear whether other mechanisms may upregulate scleraxis expression independently of TGF-β (dashed line). These mechanisms may act as a regulatory ‘cassette’, governing cardiac infarct scar formation [73], cardiac fibrosis (and potentially fibrosis in other tissues as well) [73,75], tendon formation [72,77], and possibly keloid formation [78] and wound healing [79].

A. H&E showing cross section of Keloid lesion including adjacent normal skin. IL: intra-lesional; PL: peri-leisonal compartments; Pap. Dermis: papillary dermis; Ret. Dermis: Reticular dermis. B. Keloid fibroblasts may be changed, for example by mechanical injury itself or as a consequence of the healing process eg inflammation, and exhibit epigenetic differences to normal fibroblasts that allow paracrine signalling to occur. This may result in upregulated fibrotic markers that influence increased collagen and fibronectin deposition in a self-sustaining manner. C. At the margins of the lesion, keloid fibroblasts influence (paracrine signaling) normal skin primary fibroblasts to upregulate fibrotic markers such as CTGF, PAI-1, α-SMA. CTGF is known mitogenic for fibroblasts and PAI-1 is known to increase collagen deposition through inhibiting PA activity. CTGF may increase both collagen and fibronectin concomitantly. PAI-1 may also influence cell migration by stimulating PA receptor and β3 integrin cycling by endocytosis. α-SMA may also influence cell tension and adhesion. Collectively these changes may influence migration into the surrounding healthy skin leading to high recurrence of keloid lesion, post-surgery.",pone.0075600.g011

The hypertrophic scar is limited to the area of the original wound and contains plenty of contracting myofibroblasts, which adhere to ECM via focal adhesion-like structures. Thin collagen fibres in the ECM are orientated in parallel to the cutaneous epithelia (insert). The keloid scar transcends the edges of the wound and extends into the surrounding skin. The inflammatory reaction is strong, dermal fibroblasts proliferate actively and thick hyalinised collagen bundles are orientated randomly (insert). Chronic inflammation persists, and angiogenesis is active in the keloids.",f1000research-8-20011-g0000

These MSCs undergo differentiation into aberrant fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, characteristic excessive extracellular matrix deposition, and fibrosis seen in keloid lesions. This process is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the immune system/inflammatory process.

PMC6988818,Figure 2,"A proposed model of keloid disorder showing embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells within keloid-associated lymphoid tissues (KALTs), regulated by a microenvironmental niche with resultant proliferation and accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the keloid lesion (KL) via a mesenchymal stem cell intermediate through an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (endo-MT). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the microenvironmental niche with complex interactions with the immune system/inflammation, vitamin D, vitamin D deficiency (VDD), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and hypertension. VDD which is caused by reduced sunlight/UVB radiation, and leads to increased RAS activity and the resultant hypertension. VDD also directly leads to hypertension. Increased RAS activity also activates the immune system. The complex interactions between these elements lead to activation of various pro-fibrotic signaling pathways leading to generation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Hypertension has a direct pro-fibrotic effect and contributes to the conducive microenvironment for the ESC-like cells within the KALTs. VDD increases RAS activity, with activation of the immune system/inflammation leading to an altered microenvironmental niche via the IL-6 and IL-17 axis. This increased RAS activity activates TGF-β/Smad signaling to promote EndoMT. Binding of vitamin D to VDR results in a genomic effect which counteracts the profibrotic signaling pathways. VDR transcriptional activity inhibits keloid fibroblast proliferation. VDR transcriptional activity also inhibits the pro-fibrotic TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, down-regulates genes for EndoMT, and so may influence the formation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts within KLs.

PMC7441421,Figure 2,"Signaling pathways mediated by CTHRC1 involved in the progression and metastasis of tumor. (1) TGF-β signaling pathway is quite complex, especially in terms of its effects, which are often contradictory depending on location and time. There exists a critical negative feedback regulatory loop between TGF-β-smad2/3 signaling pathway and CTHRC1. (2) WNT signaling includes WNT/β-catenin canonical pathway and β-catenin-independent noncanonical pathway. In the canonical WNT signaling, Fzd receptor and LRP5/LRP6 coreceptor are transduced to β-catenin signaling cascade for the maintenance of stem and progenitor cells. In the noncanonical WNT signaling, Fzd receptor and ROR2/PTK7/RYK coreceptor are transduced to RhoA, JNK signaling cascades for the control of tissue polarity, cell adhesion, or cell movement. The downstream molecules of the WNT/PCP pathway mainly include the small GTPase family, such as Rac1, RhoA, and JNK, which play essential roles in cancer cell migration and invasion. (3) CTHRC1 signal via WAIF1 can activate PKCδ, which is an essential component of the WNT/PCP pathway. Furthermore, PKCδ is responsible for the activation of the CTHRC1-induced ERK signaling pathway. (4) In CTHRC1/integrin β signaling pathway, the upregulation of CTHRC1 is related to the progression and metastasis of several cancers through the activation of several key signaling molecules, including Src, FAK, paxillin, MEK, ERK, and Rac1. FAK promotes cancer cell migration by regulating focal adhesion formation and turnover, which involve activation of Src and paxillin. FRA-1 is activated by CTHRC1 through the MAPK/MEK/ERK signaling, which leads to the upregulation of cyclin D1 and that promotes cell proliferation. FRA-1 also induces snail1-mediated MMP14 expression to facilitate ESCC cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway induces EMT change and MMP2/MMP9 expression. (5) HIF-1α and VEGF are activated by CTHRC1 through activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which promotes tumor angiogenesis. CTHRC1 also participates in tumor cell migration and invasion through HIF-1α/CXCR4 signals.",MI2020-9578701.002

A range of mast cell markers were used to perform a number of immunohistochemical stain analyses including tryptase, chymase, CKit, and Toluidine blue. Furthermore, we evaluated a number of other immune cell markers (M1/M2 macrophages, langerin, CD8+ cells), angiogenic markers (VEGFA and CD31) and innervation marker (PGP9.5) to identify if there was a link between mast cells and other key markers. This figure displays a panel of immunohistochemical images demonstrating the trends over 8 weeks.Key: • Mast cell tryptase (MCT): (MCT: Red fluorophore, DAPI: Blue fluorophore)• Mast cell chymase (MCC)• CKit: (CKit: Red fluorophore, DAPI: Blue fluorophore)• Toluidine Blue• Protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5)+MCT: (PGP9.5: Red fluorophore, MCT: Green fluorophore, DAPI: Blue fluorophore)• M1 macrophages: (CD68: Red fluorophore, HLA-DR-DP-DQ: Green fluorophore, DAPI: Blue fluorophore)• M2 macrophages: (CD68: Red fluorophore, CD206: Green fluorophore, DAPI: Blue fluorophore)• CD8+ cells: (CD8+: Red fluorophore, DAPI: Blue fluorophore)• Langerin• Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)• Cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31)(B) A graphical representation of the trends of the aforementioned immunohistochemical markers. All mast cell markers including mast cells tryptase and chymase, CKit and Toluidine blue demonstrated that all wounds and scars contained higher levels of mast cells compared to uninjured skin. All mast cell markers demonstrated the greatest increase in number at week 1 compared to uninjured skin (233%; P = 0.009, 333, 285, and 313%, respectively) with a gradual decrease at week 8 (86.7%, 177%, 92%, 100% respectively). These findings were similar to that of angiogenesis markers including VEGFA and CD31, with an increase at week 1 (202%; P = 0.007, 150%, respectively) compared to uninjured skin and a reduction to week 8. M1 macrophages linked with this trend with greater increases at the early time points. Mast cell tryptase was co-localized with innervation marker PGP9.5 and demonstrated close contact with nerves predominantly at later time points from week 4, 5, 6, and 8 compared to uninjured skin. All these findings may demonstrate a correlation of mast cells with innervation and angiogenesis.

PMC8106838,Fig. 1,"An overview of Notch maturation, activation and processing. Before integration into the plasma membrane, Notch receptor is decorated with different glycans by a complex series of enzymatic reactions occurring within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the Golgi network. Post-translational adducts determine a differential responsiveness of Notch-expressing cells to the ligands. Thereafter, Notch receptor is cleaved at the level of the S1 cleavage site (S1) by a furin-like convertase residing in the trans-Golgi network. The cleavage results in the formation of a heterodimeric receptor, consisting of a Notch extracellular domain (NECD) and a Notch transmembrane domain (NTMD) held together by Ca2+-dependent ionic bonds [22, 23]. Similarly, also Notch ligand undergoes a “maturation process” consisting in its endocytosis, ubiquitination by the Neuralized and Mindbomb E3 ubiquitin ligases and “recycling” to the plasma membrane [24]. Notch ligands belong to the Delta/Serrate/LAG2 (DSL) protein family. After ligand binding, the mature Notch receptor is subjected to two successive proteolytic cleavages (S2 and S3 cleavage). The first cleavage is exerted by an ADAM metalloprotease (e.g. ADAM17) close the transmembrane domain to generate the Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT) fragment (S2 cleavage). The second is operated by the γ-secretase complex within the transmembrane domain of the NEXT fragment (S3 cleavage) or in endosomes, to dump into the cytoplasm the biologically active Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (reviewed in [11]). In the cell nucleus, NICD forms a trimeric complex with RBPJ and MAML1, which initiates transcription of Notch downstream target genes",12929_2021_732_Fig1_HTML
PMC8106838,Fig. 2,"Skin architecture and Notch pathway member distribution. (Left panel) Organization of human skin. The epidermis is the thinnest and most superficial layer of the skin, it is connected to the underlying dermis through the cutaneous basement membrane zone (BMZ), the highly specialized structure which connects the epidermis to the dermis ensuring skin integrity and stability against mechanical insults. Epidermis is arranged into four distinct layers: basal, spinous, granular and stratum corneum (or horny layer). The deepest layer of the epidermis, overlaying the BMZ, is the basal layer which is followed by the spinous and the granular layers whilst the stratum corneum is the outermost. Each layer is typified by keratinocytes (KCs) at various stages of differentiation. KCs of the basal layer are characterized by their ability to proliferate. Indeed, in the basal layer, epidermal stem cells (SCs) divide to self-renew and produce transient amplifying cells (also known as committed progenitors—CPs), which possess a more limited proliferation capability. In the early phases of differentiation, CPs detach from the BMZ and move toward the stratum corneum becoming terminally differentiated cells (TDs) devoid of nuclei.

PMC9091963,Figure 1,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), its bypass loops, and converging signaling pathways. In the classical RAS (blue), angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin I (ATI) by renin. ATI is converted to angiotensin II (ATII) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ATII is the main effector for the RAS that binds to ATII receptor 1 (AT1R) and ATII receptor 2 (AT2R) to exert its physiological effects. Angiotensin 1–7 (Ang1–7) is a cleavage product of ATII which binds to the G protein–coupled receptor Mas receptor (MasR), which in turn exerts physiological effects. Ang1–7 is converted to alamandine by decarboxylation, which acts on Mas-related-G protein coupled receptors (MrgDs). ATII is converted to angiotensin III (ATIII) by aminopeptidase A, and ATIII is converted to angiotensin IV (ATIV) by aminopeptidases. ATII and ATIII bind to both AT1R and AT2R. Proteases including cathepsins B, D, and G, and chymase constitute bypass loops of the RAS (red), providing redundancies to this system. Other signaling pathways converge on the RAS (green) with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway being upstream of the RAS, activated by (pro)renin receptor.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the microenvironmental niche with complex interactions with the immune system/inflammation, vitamin D, vitamin D deficiency (VDD), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and hypertension. VDD which is caused by reduced sunlight/UVB radiation, and leads to increased RAS activity and the resultant hypertension. VDD also directly leads to hypertension. Increased RAS activity also activates the immune system. The complex interactions between these elements lead to activation of various pro-fibroproliferative signaling pathways leading to generation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Hypertension has a direct pro-fibroproliferative effect and contributes to the conducive microenvironment for the ESC-like cells within the KALTs. VDD increases RAS activity, with activation of the immune system/inflammation leading to an altered microenvironmental niche via the IL-6 and IL-17 axis. This increased RAS activity activates TGF-β/Smad signaling to promote EndoMT. Binding of vitamin D to VDR results in a genomic effect which counteracts the pro-fibroproliferative signaling pathways. VDR transcriptional activity inhibits keloid fibroblast proliferation. VDR transcriptional activity also inhibits the pro-fibroproliferative TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, down-regulates genes for EndoMT, and so may influence the formation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts within KLs.

PMC9124765,FIGURE 2,"Main Mechanotransduction Signaling Pathways in keloid. TGF-β/Smad, integrin/FAK, YAP/TAZ signaling pathways and Calcium ion signaling are the main mechanotransduction signaling pathways that mediate mechanoresponsiveness. TGF-β senses mechanical forces and signals through Smads, where Smad2/3 binds to Smad4 and enters the nucleus, where they bind DNA and initiate trans-activation of target genes. Integrin signaling induces gene expression through FAK/Erk pathway, and also interferes with TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Mechanical stimulation can promote YAP to nuclear transfer and function. The Gq-coupled receptor activated by stretch stimulation can activate PLCβ and produce DAG and IP3.

Various stressors stimulate mTORC1 and AMPK, upstream signaling molecules of autophagy, which phosphorylate the ULK1 complex. The ULK1 complex sequentially activates the VPS34 complex, which generates PI3P at membrane sources and initiates autophagosome formation. With the aid of autophagic receptors, cargos are recruited to the autophagosomes. In the degradative autophagy pathway, the autophagosomes are fused with lysosomes, and their cargos are degraded by lysosomal enzymes. In the secretory autophagy pathway, autophagosomes escape the lysosomal degradation pathway and move to the cell periphery and fuse with the plasma membrane.

(a) TRPC3 channel plays a key role, as a force transducer, in the formation of hypertrophic scar. In response to mechanical stretch, the TRPC3 channel is activated and increases the calcium influx, which triggers nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) phosphorylation. The translocation of activated NFκB into the nucleus takes place subsequently and results in the expression of fibronectin and wound contraction [69]. (b) In hypertrophic scar, mechanical stretch localizes around the fibroblasts membrane, transferring from the matrix to Piezo1, and leading to Piezo1-mediated calcium influx. The Piezo1 activity is associated with enhancement of proliferation, collagen generation and differentiation in the presence of the force [74,75]. (c) Mechanical tension in the wound bed upregulates En1 expression, generating scar-producing En1 lineage–positive fibroblasts.

Sequential skin biopsies can then be taken of the scars to allow for in-depth laboratory analysis. Meanwhile, prior to each biopsy, non-invasive devices can be used to measure the physiological, mechanical, and structural parameters of a scar at each visit compared to the individual’s baseline (normal skin) measurements. Techniques such as H&E, IHC (immunohistochemistry), q-RT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), and gene/protein/metabolite quantification can validate findings from non-invasive measurements. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, or spectroscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, can be used to assess transdermal delivery and penetration of topicals through scar tissue.

PMC9611271,Figure 7,"Proposed mechanism of action of NPWT in fibrosis. The normal fibrotic response that occurs during wound healing, and which becomes upregulated in hypertrophic scarring, is summarized in this schematic. Mechanotransduction, in the form of increased tension between the cell and the extracellular matrix, is hypothesized to lead to an upregulation of YAP. Within the cytoplasm, YAP is bound to a-catenin via 14-3-3 which prevents its nuclear sequestration. Fibrosis-promoting signals upregulated caspase-3 which cleaves a-catenin, and allows YAP to translocate into the nucleus. YAP is then able to promote transcription of En1 which induces a switch of the fibroblast phenotype, from pro-regenerative to pro-fibrotic. The fibrotic response results in an increase in the conversion of pro-collagen to collagen. The increased collagen deposition and increase in scarring then further amplifies the loop. In this study, we demonstrate that although NPWT increased the expression of YAP, En1 was decreased. The decrease in Caspase-3 would help explain this de-coupling, as decreased caspase-3 would result in decreased cleavage of a-catenin, decreased nuclear sequestration of YAP and decreased En1 transcription, as identified in our study. A decreased fibrotic response would result in decreased collagen formation. Hsp47 which is required for pro-collagen to be converted to collagen was also identified as decreased in this study, further supporting the decoupling mechanism.

The epidermis is primarily composed of keratinocytes, melanocytes, and Langerhans cells, contributing to a natural barrier against foreign objects. The dermis is a region rich in fibroblasts and immune cells, as well as collagen fibers, elastic fibers, reticular fibers, nerve endings, and capillaries, for maintaining the density and tightness of skin structure. The underlying hypodermis consists of adipocytes and connective tissue, which is conducive to warmth, cushioning, and reduction of mechanical stress. c The phase of wound healing is temporally overlapping and interdependent, including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and immune cells are important skin cells in wound healing phases.

MSC-exos, represented by ADSCs, BMSCs, hUC-MSCs, and other stem cell types, play a role in shaping the activity of fibroblasts, KCs, immune cells, and ECs. Specifically, the uploaded and shuttled proteins and ncRNAs within MSC-exos can trigger behavioral alterations in skin cells, such as proliferation, migration, invasion, differentiation, and polarization, consequently leading to angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory factor secretion, ECM reconstruction, anti-scarring effects, and tissue regeneration. Ultimately, these effects synergistically contribute to the accelerated or anti-scarring wound healing process.
