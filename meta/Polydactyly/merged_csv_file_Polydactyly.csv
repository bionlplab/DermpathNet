Cells expressing the FLAG-tagged wild-type Mks1 protein exhibited a 67-kD band (upper arrow) that was detected by both the anti-FLAG (green) and -Mks1 (red) antibodies (see merged panel), whereas a slightly smaller 64-kD band (lower arrow), the size expected for endogenous wild-type Mks1, was detected by anti-Mks1 antibody in nontransfected and transfected cells. In cells transfected with the mutant FLAG-tagged Mks1 construct, in addition to the expected 64-kD band, a lower 34-kD band was detected by both the anti-Mks1 and -FLAG antibodies (arrowhead), the size expected for the truncated mutant Mks1 protein. (D,E) Immunostaining of wild-type (D) and Mks1 mutant (E) MEFs with anti-γ-tubulin (green) and -Mks1 (red) antibodies showed that the mutant Mks1 protein is abnormally localized. In wild-type MEFs, γ-tubulin is localized in two punctate dots consistent with centrosome localization, with one showing colocalization with Mks1 (see arrowhead in D). However, in the mutant MEFs, Mks1 staining (red), although still localized in a punctate dot, is not colocalized with the γ-tubulin (green)-containing centrosomes (E, arrowhead). The inset in D of a wild-type MEF shows that Mks1 (red) is colocalized with γ-tubulin (green) and is in the centriole associated with the primary cilium, which is delineated with anti-acetylated-tubulin antibody staining (blue). By contrast, in the mutant MEFs, Mks1 (red) is not colocalized with γ-tubulin (green), either when the cilium is absent (left inset in E), or in rare instances where a cilium (blue)-like projection is observed (right inset in E).

While 53% and 50% of ciliated fibroblasts from JATD-1 and -2 patients demonstrate IFT57 accumulations in the ciliary tips, only 2% of the cells of the control display this cellular phenotype (also see panel D). Cells were analysed as per (A). (C) Compared with controls, IFT88 accumulates in distal ends of cilia in fibroblasts from JATD-1 and -2 patients. The images show a single cilium per patient or control in detail. Cells were stained with anti-IFT88 (green); antiacetylated α tubulin (marker for the ciliary axoneme, cyan); and anti-RPGRIP1L (marker for the ciliary base, red).

In hindlimb buds engineered to lack GATA6 (displayed in bottom figures), ectopic expression of Shh in the anterior mesenchyme induces expression of both Gli2/3 FL and Gli1 which activate expression of the BMP antagonist Grem1, which in turn derepresses expression of FGF4/8 in the anterior region of the apical ectodermal ridge.

Shh pathway activity and other Tbx3-reponsive factors promote digit 5 formation. In the absence of Tbx3, there is decreased expression of Hand2 and Shh and other digit 5 promoting pathways. In anterior mesenchyme, Tbx3 is in a complex with Gli3 proteins, Kif7 and Sufu and required for the stability of Gli3 FL and Gli3R. In the absence of Tbx3, Sufu and Spop protein levels are increased yet there is decreased interaction between Sufu and Kif7, and Sufu and Gli3. In mutant anterior mesenchyme, Gli3FL is barely detected: it is either degraded or converted to Gli3R. Levels of Gli3R are abnormally low due to a combination of decreased amount of Gli3FL precursor and its processing to Gli3R, and excess degradation. These findings are consistent with decreased function of cilia and Kif7 (required for processing of Gli3FL to Gli3R), and of Sufu (required for stability of both Gli3FL and Gli3R).DOI:

PI(4,5)P2 (pink hexagons) and PI(3,4,5)P3 signals (blue hexagons) localize to the cilia TZ. Protein scaffolds, including TMEM231, TCTN1, MKS1, and B9D1, localize to the TZ. In the absence of Hh pathway activation (−SAG), GPR161 levels at the cilia axoneme are increased in Inpp5e−/− pMEFs (Chávez et al., 2015; Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2015). After Hh pathway activation (+SAG) of wild-type pMEFs, PI(4,5)P2 signals decrease and PI(3,4,5)P3 signals increase at the TZ, and SMO accumulates and is retained at cilia, which is associated with the exit of GPR161 from cilia (Pal et al., 2016). After Hh pathway activation (+SAG) of Inpp5e−/− pMEFs, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 signals are disproportionately increased at the TZ (compared with wild type), which is associated with the mislocalization of TZ components TMEM231, TCTN1, MKS1, B9D1, and SEPT2 (latter not depicted), leading to the reduced accumulation and retention of SMO at cilia and thereby increased cilia axoneme levels of GPR161. Dashed arrows and lines are proposed pathways. Inhibition of PI3K-generated PI(3,4,5)P3 signals restores the localization of TZ components to cilia in Inpp5e−/− pMEFs, suggesting a role for local PI3K signaling at cilia in maintaining TZ function.",JCB_201511055_Fig8

The levels of Shh expression are dependent on the number of Hox sites occupied. SHH, in turn, is crucial for the shift in HoxD gene expression to the later genes, in particular Hoxd13 (arrow 2). HOXD13 subsequently binds to sites at the 5′ end of the ZRS, as established by Leal and Cohn (2016) (arrow 3), to maintain Shh expression later in limb development.",gr7

(b) EMSA supershift assay to identify the specific binding of the ZRS probe to HnRNP K. Lane 2 shows that the anti-HnRNP K antibody depleted the binding band S to the MT-DNA, but no changes occurred with IgG.

A. Schematic of the components of a non-motile (primary cilium) showing the axoneme (ciliary stalk), comprised of 9 pairs of microtubules. The cilium extends from a basal body, which derives from the mother centriole. Transition fibers tether the basal body to the base of the ciliary membrane. The transition zone (TZ) is adjacent to the basal body and serves as a gate for passage of proteins and lipids into and out of the cilium. Anterograde transport is accomplished by kinesin motors along with associated proteins and BBsomes propelling cargo along the microtubules; retrograde transport utilizes dynein motors rather than kinesins. Signaling proteins on the ciliary membrane represent the components of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) or other receptor complexes. B. Cross-section of the cilium demonstrates the typical 9+0 pattern of doublet microtubes in the axoneme (upper diagram) and the addition of Y-links that connect the doublet microtubes to the ciliary membrane and help form the barrier within the transition zone (bottom diagram).

Diagrams of the motile cilium (A) and the primary cilium (B) are shown. CB, cilium base; CP, cilium pocket. (C). Structures of the EVC and the EVC2/LIMBIN are shown. The EVC and EVC2/LIMBIN are N terminal anchored proteins. Blue box in the EVC and orange box in the EVC2/LIMBIN indicate domains for interaction with each other. Green box indicates the domain for the ciliary localization of the EVC2/LIMBIN and the yellow box indicates the domain for localization of the EVC2/LIMBIN at the EVC zone. Numbers indicate the numbers of amino acids in each protein. (D) EVC-EVC2/LIMBIN complexes are localized at the bottom of cilia by tethering to EFCAB7 through the W domain in EVC2/LIMBIN. In the absence of Hedgehog ligand, PTCH1 resides within the primary cilium, and GLI proteins are processed to the repressor form (GLI-R) at the centrosome. (E) In the presence of Hedgehog ligand, binding of the ligands with PTCH1 leads to exclusion of PTCH1 out of the primary cilium, which allows SMO to enter the primary cilium. Within the primary cilium, SMO interacts with EVC-EVC2/LIMBIN at the bottom of the primary cilium, which allows GLI trafficking into the primary cilium and accumulation at the tip of the primary cilium. After entering the primary cilium, GLI are processed to the activator form (GLI-A). GLI activators exit the primary cilium and translocate into the nucleus to activate Hedgehog responsive genes. (F) EVC or EVC2/LIMBIN loss of function leads to absence of EVC-EVC2/LIMBIN complexes within the primary cilium. When Hedgehog signaling is activated, SMO still moves into the primary cilium, but without EVC-EVC2/LIMBIN complexes, SMO cannot lead to full activation of GLI. (G) In Weyers form of mutant cells, EVC-EVC2/LIMBIN complexes cannot be restricted at the bottom of primary cilium due to no interactions with EFCAB7 caused by loss of the W domain in EVC2/LIMBIN, thus EVC-EVC2/LIMBIN-SMO complex cannot lead to full activation of GLI.",jdb-08-00025-g002

(A) Investigation of Hh signaling fibroblast. Expression profile of GLI1 mRNA was normalized to the amount of endogenous GADPH mRNA. Pur-induced expression of GLI1 was significantly increased in control cells compared to patient fibroblasts (BBS1−/−: * p = 0.015711, BBS5A−/−: * p = 0.012758, BBS5B−/−: * p = 0.014811, BBS10A−/−: * p = 0.014944, BBS10B−/−: * p = 0.013701). Compared to unstimulated cells, a significant increase in GLI1 expression as an effect of pur stimulation was observed in the control (Ctrl), BBS1−/− and BBS10A−/− fibroblasts (Ctrl: ** p = 0.001787, BBS1−/−: * p = 0.047977, BBS10A−/− = * p = 0.039275) but not in the other cell types (BBS5A−/−: p = 0.148291, BBS5B−/−: p = 0.232452, BBS10B−/−: p = 0.098018). (B) Investigation of Hh signaling in siRNA transfected RPE1 cells. Expression profile of GLI1 was normalized to the amount of endogenous GADPH. Cells transfected with siSCR showed a significant increase in GLI1 expression after pur stimulation (siSCR * p = 0.038869). The increase in siBBS1 and siBBS10 transfected cells was smaller, but still significant, compared to unstimulated cells (siBBS1: * p = 0.020942, siBBS10: * p = 0.046011). No significant effect was observed in siBBS5 transfected cells (siBBS5: p = 0.323142). SiRNA transfection led to a substantial reduction in expression of the BBS genes (Supplementary Figure S1). (C) Ciliary localization of SMO in fibroblast lines. The cells were labeled with anti-AC-TUB (cilia marker, red) and anti-SMO antibody (green). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI staining (blue).

The fibroblasts were grown under serum-reduced conditions (0.05% FCS) for 48 h in the presence or absence of 5 µM pur for the final 24 h, as indicated. SMO was present in a large number of the cilia in all BBS patient fibroblasts, both in the presence and the absence of pur. Significantly more SMO was present in the BBS fibroblast cells compared to a pool of control cells (Ctrl.pool: Ctrl.A + Ctrl.D, n = 315) in the absence of pur (BBS1−/−: *** p = 1.28 × 10−12, n = 156, BBS5A−/−: *** p = 2.76 × 10−8, n = 145, BBS5B−/−: *** p = 6.95 × 10−5, n = 136, BBS10A−/−: *** p = 2.26 × 10−5, n = 134, and BBS10B−/−: *** p = 0.00014, n = 141).

The transition zone (red) at the ciliary base controls entry into the cilium. Right: E1 (pink), E2 (green), and E3 (purple) facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin to appropriate substrates to control ciliogenesis and ciliary function. Left: Many ciliary proteins undergo post‐translation sumoylation to control their ciliary entry. TOPORS is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that also has sumoylation activity.

34346313,PMC8378848,Ciliary and extraciliary Gpr161 pools repress hedgehog signaling in a tissue-specific manner.,Elife,2023-12-17-22-15-40,Figure 8.,"Gpr161 ciliary pools determine Hh pathway repression-regulated morpho-phenotypic spectrum.(A) Neural tube development. Hh is expressed from the notochord. Gli2A-mediated threshold activation mediates floorplate and ventral-most progenitor patterning. Gli3R regulates intermediate level patterning. Ciliary disruption prevents patterning of all ventral progenitors. Complete loss of Gpr161 in ko causes ventralization of all ventral progenitors from excessive Gli2A generation and loss of Gli3R. Lack of Gpr161 ciliary pools in Gpr161mut1/ko reduces Gli3R formation sufficiently to cause intermediate level expansion of Nkx6.1 but does not generate excessive GliA to cause ventralization of floor plate markers. Caudal spina bifida and exencephaly persists in Gpr161mut1/ko similar to Gpr161 ko. (B) Limb development. Shh expression from ZPA starting from E9.75 establishes posterior gradient of pathway targets such as Ptch1/Gli1. Anterior Gli3R gradient also limits expression of genes such as Hoxd13 to the posterior mesenchyme. Ciliary disruption causes preaxial polydactyly from lack of Gli3R induced anterior expansion of 5’Hoxd gene expression. Gpr161 ko prevents forelimb formation. Conditional deletion of Gpr161 in limb mesenchyme using Prx1-Cre; Gpr161f/f (Prx1-Gpr161 cko) causes increased Hh pathway targets, reduced Gli3R, and expanded Hoxd13 in limb buds contributing to polydactyly. Loss of Gpr161 ciliary pools in Gpr161mut1/mut1 causes increased Hh pathway targets, reduced Gli3R, and expanded Hoxd13 in limb buds contributing to polydactyly. Shh expression in the posterior limb bud is diffuse, likely from lack of counter-antagonism between Gli3R and dHand. Abbreviations: AER, anterior ectodermal ridge; ZPA, zone of polarizing activity; A, anterior; P, posterior, Pr, proximal; D, distal. (C) Facial development. Shh is expressed from the frontonasal ectodermal zone in the medial nasal processes. Threshold repression by both Gli2R and Gli3R prevents midfacial widening. Ciliary disruption, or lack of both Gli2/3 causes midfacial widening, which is prevented by forced Gli3R expression. Loss of Gpr161 ciliary pools in Gpr161mut1/mut1 phenocopies Gpr161 deletion in craniofacial mesenchyme using Wnt1-Cre; Gpr161f/f (Wnt1-Gpr161 cko) by showing midfacial widening and increased levels of Shh pathway targets. Gli2 loss is unable to rescue midfacial widening and increased Shh pathway targets in Gpr161 ko background, suggesting reduced GliR contributing to these phenotypes. Abbreviations: FEZ, frontonasal ectodermal zone; LNP, lateral nasal process; MNP, medial nasal process, Mx, maxillary process. (D) Model of Gpr161 ciliary and extraciliary pools in Hh pathway. Both ciliary and extraciliary pools of Gpr161 contribute to GliR formation by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Complete loss of Gpr161 prevents Gli2/3 phosphorylation by PKA. Gli2 is less efficient in repressor formation than Gli3. Unphosphorylated Gli2 is dissociated from Sufu and accumulates in ciliary tips. GliA formation is dependent on lack of PKA phosphorylation but likely occurs downstream of Gli2 ciliary accumulation. Smo might further promote GliA formation. Gli2 accumulation in ciliary tips and GliA formation also occurs in Ankmy2 knockout where trafficking of ACs to cilia is affected. Loss of ciliary Gpr161 restricts ciliary cAMP-mediated PKA activation but does not hinder extraciliary Gpr161 from cAMP production. Such extraciliary production might happen in the endomembrane compartment, but PKA regulatory subunits involved are not known. Restricted phosphorylation limits Gli3R formation but is still sufficient to dissociate Gli2 from Sufu causing accumulation in ciliary tips. However, GliA formation is impacted. Tissue regions that depend on GliR are specifically affected from loss of ciliary pools of Gpr161. Abbreviations: RI/RII, type I/II PKA regulatory subunits.",elife-67121-fig8

The amino-terminal part is modified with palmitate (mediated by HHAT) and cholesterol (mediated by carboxyl end of the initial polypeptide). The active part of SHH may be transported to a cytoneme or bound to DISP1.

(A). In the absence of SHH, PTCH1 at the base of the cilium blocks SMO from entry into the cilium. GPR161 activates PKA (protein kinase A), which in turn phosphorylates full-length GLI transcription factors. As a result, full-length GLI becomes cleaved by the proteasome at the base of the cilium to form GLIR (repressor form of GLI). (B). CDON/BOC and GAS1 are required for SHH signalling and the proposed role for these co receptors is outlined in [6]. On arrival at the target cell, the SCUBE2–SHH complex is bound by co receptors CDON/BOC, SHH is passed to GAS1 then to its receptor PTCH1. Binding of SHH to PTCH1 causes activation of SMO, resulting in the removal of GPR161 and reduction of PKA activity. Full length GLI is no longer cleaved to form GLIR. (C). When SHH binds to its receptor PTCH1, PTCH1 is endocytosed, releasing the inhibition on SMO. SMO accumulates in the cilium. A complex of SUFU, KIF7 and GLI is transported to the top of the cilium where the full length GLI is phosphorylated and converted to GLIA (activator form of GLI) (modified after [12,16,17]).",ijms-22-09854-g002a

During normal gut development (Left), the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gradient defines the concentric architecture of the intestine as seen by the discrete PATCHED (Ptch) pattern of expression. SHH readout in the mesenchyme immediately adjacent to the epithelium restricts smooth muscle differentiation to allow the connective tissue of the submucosa to develop. In the absence of a functional TALPID3 protein (Right), the SHH readout is lost, as shown by the diffused Ptch expression. Loss of the SHH readout leads to ectopic spread of the smooth muscle differentiation domain adjacent to the epithelium. (Left – bottom) During normal gut development, the precise readout of the SHH gradient directs the pattern of CSPG expression, restricting ENCC to the locations where the enteric nervous system (ENS) will form. The ENS regulates smooth muscle and mucosa growth and differentiation via a TALPID3-dependent signaling (green arrows). (Right – bottom) In the absence of a functional TALPID3 protein, SHH readout is lost, which coincides with a loss of CSPG expression. This loss of expression permits ectopic ENCC migration resulting in scattered ENCC throughout the gut mesenchyme.
