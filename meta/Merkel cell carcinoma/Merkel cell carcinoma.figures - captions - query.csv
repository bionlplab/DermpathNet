The number of the wildtype codons is indicated above the peaks in the SNaPshot® assay. In brief, the SNaPshot® assay comprises a multiplex PCR for exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA, followed by extension of 4 primers specific for the most frequent PIK3CA hotspot mutation loci. Because fluorescent dideoxynucleotides are used for this primer extension step, only one peak appears at the base position with the potential mutation.

PMC6319370,Fig. 2,"Structure and function of the Merkel cell polyomavirus genome.a | Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a small double-stranded DNA virus with a 5,387 bp circular genome that includes a non-coding control region (NCCR), an early region containing T antigen genes that coordinate viral replication and a late region containing viral protein (VP) genes for virion capsid proteins. b | Multiple transcripts are generated from the early region by alternative splicing and possibly alternative start sites, including large T antigen (LT), small T antigen (ST), 57 kT antigen (57 kT), alternative frame of the large T open reading frame (ALTO) and microRNA MCV-miR-M1. c | Cellular functions of the MCPyV LT. The DnaJ domain mediates binding to heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, with a role in viral replication. The MCPyV unique region (MUR) includes the retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB) binding motif responsible for direct inhibition of RB, thus enabling cell cycle progression to S phase. The MUR mediates binding to the vacuolar sorting protein VPS39. The carboxyl-terminal helicase domain is a critical mediator of viral replication, with contributions from the adjacent zinc-finger (ZN), leucine zipper (LZ) and origin binding domain (OBD). The integrated MCPyV genome present in MCPyV-positive MCCs harbours truncating mutations in LT that disrupt the helicase domain, resulting in a replication-incompetent mutant form of LT that nonetheless retains the ability to promote cell cycle progression. d | Cellular functions of MCPyV ST. ST recruits L-MYC to the EP400 chromatin remodelling complex in order to mediate changes in gene expression. The LT-stabilizing domain (LSD) is proposed to inhibit E3 ubiquitin ligase activity via interactions with F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBXW7) and cell division cycle protein 20 homologue (CDC20), resulting in increased oncoprotein stability and cap-dependent mRNA translation, respectively. ST also interacts with the protein phosphatase complex PP4 to inhibit nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling. 4E-BP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; CR1, conserved region 1; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; NLS, nuclear localization signal.",41571_2018_103_Fig2_HTML,NotMatch,NotMatch
PMC6319370,Fig. 3,"Proposed MCC tumorigenesis pathways in the presence or absence of Merkel cell polyomavirus.a | In virus-negative Merkel cell carcinomas (VN-MCCs), the cell of origin undergoes ultraviolet-mediated DNA damage, resulting in a high tumour mutational burden and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, including RB1 and TP53. The high mutational burden might result in the expression of tumour neoantigens that represent potential targets for antitumour immunity. b | In virus-positive MCC (VP-MCC), the cell of origin is infected by wild-type Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), which undergoes episomal replication. Rarely, MCPyV can become integrated into the host cell genome and further acquires a truncating mutation of the large T antigen (LT), resulting in deficient viral replication with continued production of viral oncoproteins. The resulting tumour has a low burden of cellular genomic mutations. Hence, for patients with VP-MCCs, T antigen proteins (rather than neoantigens) might be better targets for treatments designed to promote antitumour immunity.",41571_2018_103_Fig3_HTML,Match,NotMatch
PMC6319370,Fig. 4,"Signalling pathways that modulate antitumour immunity.Antitumour immunity is modulated by signalling molecules expressed on immune cells, including T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), as well as Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) cells. Adaptive antitumour immunity is primarily mediated by the presentation of tumour antigens on MHCs of either tumour cells or APCs. In the context of MCC, tumour-associated antigens can be either viral protein products in Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)-positive MCC or, in MCPyV-negative tumours, neoantigens resulting from somatic mutations. In virus-positive-MCC tumour cells, antigen presentation by MHC complexes is commonly suppressed through epigenetic silencing. Multiple signalling pathways have the potential to either stimulate (such as OX40–OX40L) or suppress antitumour immunity (such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)– programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)). These various immune signalling pathways should be considered potential therapeutic targets.

PMC6635480,Figure 1,"Targeting pathways and molecules in the treatment of NMSC. (A) Hedgehog signaling pathway. Activation of Hedgehog signaling is initiated by the cell-surface protein, SMO, which is inhibited by another cell-surface protein, PTCH1. Binding of the Hedgehog ligand to PTCH1 releases this inhibition and thereby activates the pathway. Mutations in PTCH1 result in loss of its inhibitory function, while mutations in SMO lead to constitutive signaling activation. Vismodegib and sonidegib are oral small molecule inhibitors of SMO, which block HH signaling activation. (B) Receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream MAPK and PI3-AKT signaling pathways. Aberrant overexpression or mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR and HER2, cause activation of downstream signaling pathways, thus triggering several tumorigenic processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival, and resistance to apoptosis.

The suprabasal and differentiating layers of keratinocytes are committed to differentiation, expressing K1, K10, and other markers, like filaggrin and loricrin. Other resident epidermal cell types include Melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. The ultraviolet rays (UVR) from the sun penetrate the atmosphere and the different layers of the skin. UVC with the greatest energy photons (shorter wavelengths) is totally absorbed by the ozone layer while UVB with intermediate energy photons (wavelengths) that damage DNA in epidermal cells penetrates the upper layers of the epidermis. UVA with low energy photons (longer wavelengths) penetrates deeper into the upper dermis causing damage to collagen and elastic tissue, even skin cancers and other skin manifestations.",cells-08-00803-g002,NotMatch,NotMatch

PMC6721560,Figure 4,"Schematic illustration of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Arrows represent activation, whereas bars represent inhibition [50]. Upon receptor activation, insulin receptor substrate (IRS) activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is in turn phosphorylated to generate phosphatidylinositol [3,4,5]-trisphosphate (PIP3). Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) can dephosphorylate PIP3 to regulate the pathway activity. AKT is activated through the binding of PIP3 to its amino terminal, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (stripped), which then promotes the translocation of AKT to the plasma membrane, where the carboxyl terminal T308 is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), and S473 is phosphorylated by mTORC2. AKT regulates several cellular processes such as survival and cell proliferation, through a variety of downstream proteins like glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β), Forkhead Box O (FOXO), amid others (not shown). AKT is able to directly phosphorylate and thus inactivates the 40 kDa proline-rich protein (PRAS40), relieving the suppressive regulation on mTORC1 activity. Furthermore, AKT can phosphorylate and inactivate the tuberous sclerosis (TSC) tumor suppressor protein complex that acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the RAS homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) small G protein to regulate its activity. Retention of the Rheb-GTP bound form activates mTOR, which is comprised of two main complexes that are associated with diverse proteins such as Raptor, mLST8, PRAS40 and Deptor for complex I (mTORC1), and Rictor, mLST8, Deptor, mSin1 and Protor for complex II (mTORC2). mTORC1 is regulated by a variety of environmental signals mediated via several proteins including REDD1/2 (regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1/2), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), among others. mTORC1 phosphorylates downstream S6K1 (p70S6 Kinase 1) and modulates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), which discharges it from hindering eIF4E, and enabling 40S ribosomal subunit to be recruited to mRNAs, leading to the initiation of protein translation. S6K also phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 that is also involved in translational regulation by the 40S ribosomal subunit. By contrast, the regulation of mTORC2 is still under investigation, but it is known to be regulated by growth factors. mTORC2 phosphorylates distinct groups of proteins, enabling the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and migration via activating protein kinase C α (PKC-α), small GTPases (Rhoa, Rac1 and Cdc42), and focal adhesion proteins, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin. Essentially, the activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-RSK pathway mediated by growth factor is another mechanism of regulated crosstalk with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",cells-08-00803-g004,NotMatch,NotMatch

These can be further spliced at the C-terminus, producing α, β, or γ isoforms. ΔNp63α is the most abundant isoform in normal skin as well as in skin tumours. p63 protein harbours TA (transcription activation), PR (proline-rich), DBD (DNA-binding), OD (oligomerisation), SAM (sterile α-motif), and TID (transcriptional inhibitory) domains. (b) p63 is expressed in most cells of the basal and suprabasal layers of the epidermis but its expression is decreased in the upper spinous layer and absent in the granular and cornified layers of epidermis. p63 intensively marks basal cells of the sebaceous and sweat glands, yet it is not present in mature sebocytes as well as the ductal cells of sweat glands. The cells of the hair matrix, hair bulge stem cells, and outer root sheath show high expression of p63. By contrast, well differentiated cells of the inner root sheath and hair shaft lack p63. Melanocytes and cells of mesenchymal origin, fibroblasts and endothelial cells (not shown), are p63 negative. No data are available regarding p63 expression in Langerhans and Merkel cells (shown as negative); (c) In basal layer keratinocytes, p63 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of cell proliferation as well as adhesion. Through direct binding to the promoters of target genes, p63 can repress (upper panel) or activate (lower panel) gene expression; (d) During the early stages of keratinocyte differentiation, p63 activates expression of the master regulator of epithelial differentiation, ZNF750, and chromatin remodelers, Brg1 and Satb1. Furthermore, p63 co-operates with chromatin remodeler complex SWI/SNF and binds to epithelial-specific enhancers to allow for the transcriptional activation of a terminal differentiation programme (e.g., ZNF185).",ijms-20-05781-g001,NotMatch,NotMatch

Color-coded exons corresponding to each specific domain: WD40 repeats mediate substrate recognition (purple); F-box recruits the SCF complex (blue); dimerization domain (orange). Cdc20 has unique domains such as C box, KEN box, Mad2-interacting motif (MIM). A common feature among these E3 ligases is the WD domain. The first β-strand of WD40 completes the last blade structure (dark purple) to create the closed ring propeller-structure. b Classical tertiary structure of the WD40 domains of E3 ligases.

Bottom: Collision of a moving fork with a stalled fork leads to a dsDNA break at the moving fork.

PMC7983043,Figure 2. ,"Suggested algorithm to interpret Merkel cell polyomavirus oncoprotein antibody test (AMERK test).(A) For seropositive patients, the AMERK titer decreases significantly within 3 months after successful treatment. A late baseline test that comes back negative (<74) may indicate that: the patient produced antibodies initially, but the antibody levels decreased to undetectable range after the tumor was removed, or the patient does not produce antibodies to MCPyV oncoprotein. In contrast, if the patient produces antibodies at any time after diagnosis, this test is positive and could be used for future surveillance. (B) AMERK titer between 74 and 150 is considered to be ‘borderline’. In our practice, this typically represents seropositivity, particularly if subsequent titer changes out of the borderline range. If titer still stays within borderline range in subsequent draws, AMERK titer for the patient is not reliable. (C) If the baseline test was done after more than 3 months from the initial diagnosis, or the size of MCC tumor at the time of the baseline test was extremely small (e.g., <5 mm), we consider repeating the AMERK test if the patient recurs in the future. (D) The AMERK test is most reliable for surveillance on patients who have not experienced a recurrence, or for detecting their first recurrence. After multiple recurrences and/or immunotherapy (systemic or local), the titer change of the AMERK testing is less reflective of disease burden. (E) Individual baseline titer could vary from less than 74 to more than 115,000. While this flowchart is designed to guide clinicians to interpret a test result at a single timepoint compared with the previous one, we find that consistent trends over time better correspond to disease status in the clinical setting. For instance, if the patient’s AMERK titer is slowly trending upward, we suggest interpreting the result as an ‘increase’ of titer and considering imaging studies. (F) In general, for the first 12 months following diagnosis, we recommend the patients have regular scans per the initial recurrence risk as determined by their disease stage and other factors (https://merkelcell.org/prognosis/recur/). In our practice, if the AMERK titer decreases by more than 70% from baseline, shows decreasing or stable trend for several consecutive draws, and the patient is more than 12 months out from their original diagnosis, we consider that AMERK can safely substitute for scans for surveillance. (G) Most patients that have two antibody tests with increased titers (e.g. ≥30% change) will eventually have MCC recurrence [9]. (H) Recurrence risk depends on stage at diagnosis and other patient characteristics. For most patients, it decreases dramatically by 2 years after diagnosis (https://merkelcell.org/prognosis/recur/). We generally recommend discontinuing or decreasing frequency of imaging and/or AMERK studies when a patient’s individual residual risk of recurrence is below 2%, or by 5–6 years after initial diagnosis. (I) To establish if either increasing or decreasing trend is outside of the margin of error. (J) PET/CT or CT with contrast could be considered. Some studies and our experience indicate that PET/CT has higher sensitivity. If imaging studies fail to locate disease repeatedly in the setting of rising antibodies, consider alternative scan modalities (e.g., MRI) or investigate other body parts (e.g., brain, extremities that were not included in the previous scan). (K) Concurrent imaging test may be indicated. If no clinically evident disease is detected in the setting of AMERK titer increase, we suggest considering more sensitive scan modalities (e.g., PET/CT) or evaluating anatomical site that has not been evaluated by imaging (e.g., extremities, brain). (L) The additive benefit of the AMERK test when patients are receiving routine scans is unknown.CT: Computed tomography; MCC: Merkel cell carcinoma; MCPyV: Merkel cell polyomavirus; PET: Positron emission tomography.",fon-17-1363-g2,Match,NotMatch

PMC8301416,Figure 3,"Pathways deregulated in MCCP and MCCN. (A) Cell cycle regulatory genes—In MCCP, MCPyV LT binds and inactivates pRB, allowing E2F-mediated transcription of S-phase cell cycle genes. The ST-MYCL-EP400 complex inactivates p53, through ubiquitin ligase (MDM2, MDM4, and CK1α) activation, determining the loss of p21 mediated cell cycle checkpoint. In MCCN, RB1 and TP53 are mutated and, in turn, the encoded proteins lose their function, promoting uncontrolled cell cycling. (B) MYC-dependent genes—In MCCP, the ST-MYCL-EP400 complex induces several MYC target genes, including CDC42, CFL1, CTTN, and RHOA, which are involved in cell migration and invasion. In MCCN, the MYCL gene is amplified, providing oncogenic activity, although it is not clear if MYCL acts equivalently to the ST-MYCL-EP400 complex. (C) The neuroendocrine differentiation program is driven by the ATOH1 transcription factor. In MCCP, the activity of the ATOH1 is partially repressed by the chromatin remodeler LSD1-RCOR2-INSM1 complex that is transactivated by the ST-MYCL-EP400 complex. LSD1 removes H3K4me2 and H3K4me1 marks, acting as a gene silencer. In MCCN, the methyltransferases KMT2D and KMT2C, which oppose LSD1 activity, are frequently mutated and therefore probably counteract ATOH1 signaling.

PMC8307089,Figure 2,"A model of how cell cycle dysregulation in Merkel cell carcinoma may predispose to ATR inhibition. Cellular components that restrain progression of the cell cycle are depicted in red; cell cycle progression accelerators are shown in green. In virus-positive (VP) MCC, Rb is directly inactivated by binding the MCPyV LT oncoprotein. p53 (via activation of MDM2/4) and Myc signaling are dysregulated in VP-MCC by the sT oncoprotein. Similarly, in virus-negative (VN) MCC, UV mutations disrupt Rb and p53 and promote Myc signaling. These changes disable the G1 cell cycle checkpoint in both VP- and VN-MCCs, making it potentially more reliant on ATR to ensure completion of DNA replication in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Stalled replication forks normally recruit ATR and lead to Chk1 activation. If ATR is inhibited, this disrupts the Chk1-dependent activation of the intra-S and G2/M checkpoints. This in-turn causes stalled replication forks to not be detected, may lead to double-strand breaks and, as depicted by the dashed arrow, promotes premature entry into M phase. This process may manifest as premature chromatin condensation (PCC) and lead to an immunogenic type of mitotic cell death.

PMC8395396,Figure 1,"The tumour microenvironment and targets of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in MCC patients. Tumour-cell death causes the release of tumour antigens, which are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs), to be processed and presented on major histocompatibility complexes II (MHC II) to CD4+ or on MHC I to CD8+ T-cells. A crucial co-stimulatory signal is given by the interaction between CD28 on the T-cell and the B7 family proteins on the DCs. Upon activation, CD4+ T-cells secrete IL-2 and TNFα, which stimulates CD8+ T-cell activation and proliferation. DCs secrete IL-12, which is important for the Th1 response. After activation, CD8+ T-cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2 and IFNγ, and may be able to directly kill tumour cells. However, because of the immunosuppressive TME, inhibitory checkpoint receptors such as PD-1 on the T-cell and its ligand PD-L1 on APCs are up-regulated. Other checkpoints such as CTLA-4, which competes with CD28 for binding B7 are further up-regulated. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) inhibit DCs via TIGIT and LAG3 binding to MHC II, preventing DCs to activate T-cells. They also secret IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, which further down-regulates the immune response. Due to chronic antigen exposure, T-cells often display a reversible exhausted phenotype with high expression of inhibitory checkpoint molecules and can therefore be targeted with checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). There are anti-PD-L1 antibodies (A) such as Avelumab or anti-PD-1 (B) antibodies such as Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, preventing the interaction of this inhibitory checkpoint receptor with its ligand. Anti-CTLA-4 (C) antibodies such as Ipilimumab are only used in combination with other ICIs in MCC. In currently ongoing clinical trials, other checkpoint inhibitors such as INCAGN02390 (D) to target TIM-3, Druvalumab (A), or Retifanlimab (B) are investigated. Additional cell types found in the TME are natural killer (NK) cells, which express additional inhibitory receptors on their surface (NKG2A) whereby their secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ is suppressed. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are immunosuppressive M2 macrophages which express high levels of PD-L1 and CD200 (OX-2), and prevent the development of inflammatory macrophages. In conclusion, the TME is an immunosuppressive environment that favours tumour growth and evasion rather than killing of the tumour by the immune system.

Epidermal progenitor cells have been proposed as an alternative original cell with proliferative potential [94,95]. Pre- or pro-B cells have also been hypothesized to be the cell of origin, due to the expression of specific B cell markers (including TdT and PAX5) in MCC [96]. Dermal fibroblasts support MCPyV infection and may therefore also act as the site of oncogenic transformation [77].

This pipeline augments the manual data abstraction implemented for the capture of nonstructured EHR data. Data collection and single-site analysis are streamlined at each institution.

Once delimited data are assigned as R object “dt,” a single-line command is used to transform the data into the REDCap-ready registry configuration for import based on source type (eg ehr_reformat(), or edw_reformat()). eLAB is designed to de-identify the patient names/medical record numbers (MRNs) with registry-specific record identification (record_id) numbers. Furthermore, 300 subtypes of laboratory tests (ehr_labs) are remapped into 35 registry fields (mcc_labs). Once imported into the registry via an output csv file or using REDCap API token, single-line commands are used for outcomes research and analysis (baselabs_os()), as well as remapping for interoperability with standardized SNOMED or LOINC code (loinc()). LOINC remapping is an optional feature provided by eLAB to allow the MCCPR data to be linked to other non-MCCPR clinical research efforts/registries that may utilize LOINC.

PMC8827011,Figure 3.,"eLAB and the data dictionary to harmonize multi-institutional data aggregation. The data dictionary, once uploaded into REDCap, creates the lab capture system or the “Labs instrument.” eLAB is designed to reformat and normalize laboratory values and units that are bulk-pulled from the EHR. eLAB transforms the data into a format predefined by the data dictionary and its associated variable codes. eLAB performs the primary data cleansing steps. However, one final quality check is also utilized at the very end during import of data. If an attempt is made to import any data that is incorrectly reformatted (ie numerical value for a date field that is not in the acceptable M/D/Y format), an error is set off during the final stage of import by the REDCap scaffold that is associated with the preconfigured design of the data dictionary. Data with errors will fail to import into REDCap. The REDCap data import tool will display the data that does not conform to the configuration designated by the data dictionary, and it will be flagged, alongside error messages that provide guidance on how to resolve the issue. The data will have to be re-evaluated and corrected. Only when the data are free of errors and all issues are resolved, a successful upload/import into REDCap can occur. With every site in the multi-institutional registry utilizing eLAB and the exact same data dictionary, aggregation of the data is straightforward and only requires combining/appending the outputs of each site together (ie each site will combine individual “.csv file” into one large multisite “.csv file” for the final aggregated data).

Then, the cell lines of choice—a determined MCC cell line or primary human keratinocytes (PHKs)—were seeded on top of the dermal equivalent and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The next day, dermal equivalents were lifted on stainless metal grids so that cell cultures could grow at the air–liquid interface for 10–12 days.

The total number of suprabasal cells were then divided by the total number of basal cells to calculate the suprabasal:basal ratio. Ten-10X images were captured for each sample, analyzed using the process outlined above, and an average suprabasal:basal ratio calculated. Within each group, 5–8 mice were included and an average of the averages are plotted in the bar graph. Error bars represent standard deviation. A Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare values among groups. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (**p≤0.002, ***p≤0.0007).

BrdU-positive cells contain brown nuclei. The black line indicates the basement membrane between the epithelium and the underlying dermis. Corresponding representative H&E-stained images are included as a reference (top). All scale bars = 100 μm.

Suprabasal cells included all other cells within the stratified epithelium that were not touching the basement membrane. An image is shown with brackets identifying the suprabasal layer and a line pointing to the basal layer. The number of total, basal, and suprabasal BrdU-positive cells in the stratified epithelium were counted in 10 fields of view per slide from each mouse per group. These values were then divided by the total number of epithelial cells in each sample to calculate the percentage of BrdU-positive cells, and these values were then averaged. An average of the averages was then calculated for each group of mice. Error bars indicate standard deviation. A Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare values among groups.

Cells were transfected with an E2F-luciferase reporter construct (6XE2F; Firefly luciferase) only, or co-transfected with 6XE2F reporter plus SV40 large T antigen (LT), the MCPyV LT, or human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) E7 protein. In all conditions, cells were co-transfected with a control plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase that was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. At 48 hours post-transfection, a dual-luciferase assay was performed to quantify firefly and Renilla luciferase expression in each condition. Following normalization of all luciferase values (firefly/Renilla), the values in cells only transfected with the reporter (6XE2F Only) were set to 1.0 and all other values were compared to this value within each MEFs cell strain.

PMC9449649,Fig. 1,"MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways, crosstalk and targeting. (a) Activated GEFs proteins catalyze Ras-GTP exchange and lead to the activation of Raf, which causes a phosphorylation cascade that ultimately will activate ERK1/2 and RSK. (b) PI3K generates PIP3, which recruits Akt and then it is activated by mTORC2. PTEN acts as a negative regulator of PI3K. Akt promotes the activation of mTORC1, which in turn phosphorylates 4E-BP1 and S6K. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 inhibits its ability to bind eIF4E mRNA cap-binding protein. MCPyV sT-ag maintains the hyperphosphorylated state of 4E-BP1. TSC is a regulator of mTORC1, and it functions as a guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein for the small guanine nucleotide-binding protein Rheb. The activation of A and B leads to increased cell survival and proliferation, activation of glycolytic metabolism and protein translation. The arrows in red indicate cross-activation mechanisms.

An 86-year-old immunocompetent man was initially diagnosed with a 10 cm Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) of the left buttock. His baseline fluorodeoxyglucose/positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) for staging during the initial workup showed an incidental abnormal finding of a hypermetabolic mass in the right atrium (panel a-i) and the intense FDG avidity on PET/CT made a myxoma less likely as the cause (panel a-ii). The lesion was then evaluated by cardiac ultrasound (panel b). On subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there was an irregular mass in the right atrium that was attached to the interatrial septum and extended superiorly to the distal superior vena cava (panel c-i). This mass demonstrated high signal intensity on the T2 black-blood sequence (panel c-ii), weak perfusion on perfusion MRI (panel c-iii), and late gadolinium enhancement on late postcontrast sequence (panel c-iv), which indicated that this did not represent a thrombus. The cardiac mass was biopsied under intracardiac echocardiography (panel d) with pathology confirming metastatic MCC. The patient started first-line systemic therapy with avelumab followed by palliative radiation therapy to the primary MCC of the left buttock with 30 Gray (Gy) in 10 fractions and to the right atrium mass with 20 Gy in 8 fractions. Compared to contrast CT performed before RT (panel e), a restaging CT scan performed 1 month after RT completion showed complete resolution of the right cardiac MCC mass (panel f). His primary MCC disease on the buttock also had a complete response. He discontinued avelumab due to grade 3 immune-related pneumonitis 8 months after, without clinically apparent evidence of MCC. Unfortunately, approximately 6 months after avelumab discontinuation, he was found to have a new enhancing left pericardial lesion measuring 1.9 × 1.2 cm in size on contrast CT outside the radiation field. On a Gallium-68 (Ga68) Dotatate PET/CT, there was no uptake in the initially treated right atrium (panel g-i), but there was a new intense radiotracer uptake in the left pericardial lesion (blue arrow. Red * showed physiological uptakes) (panel g-ii). He had a single 8 Gy fraction of radiation therapy to the new left pericardial mass, but the lesion progressed. Monthly somatostatin analog therapy was initiated but discontinued after 7 doses due to disease progression. The patient then switched to combination therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, but he passed away from non-MCC causes 6 months after initiating the combination immunotherapy.

PMC9775569,Figure 1,"Proposed etiological pathways for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). (A) UVA and UVB rays cause DNA damage, which generates ROS that contributes to the oxidation of DNA bases. This results in the accumulation of mutations, especially in the TP53 and RB1 genes, leading to the inactivation of tumor suppressive pathways. Additionally, increased ROS levels increase HIF-1α activity. HIF-1α activates NF-κB/STAT 3 pathways and angiogenesis, leading to increased tumor cell proliferation and the promotion of metastasis. (B) 80% of MCC cases are attributed to MCPyV etiology, which is first initiated by MCPyV infection. Following integration of the viral genome into the host genome, two neoantigens: sT and LT antigens, are expressed. sT and LT are involved in the inhibition of cell pathways: retinoblastoma, tumor suppressor p53, 4E-BP1, and Fbw7, which contribute to increased cell cycle progression, decreased tumor suppression, increased translation, and decreased proteasomal activity, respectively. Activation of PP4C and PP4R1 subunits inhibit NEMO, which decreases antiviral response and leads to failure of NF–kB signaling.

PMC9775569,Figure 2,"Immune cells and secretory molecules within the tumor microenvironment (TME) shape the course of Merkel cell carcinoma. Shown here are several key cellular components and secretory molecules that mediate the balance of cytotoxic versus suppressive responses surrounding tumor cells. Presence of CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ TH1, NK cells, DN γδ T-cells, and TAMs contribute to antitumor effects through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. During early stages of tumor development, immune cells, namely NK and CD8+ T-cells, recognize and eliminate immunogenic cancer cells, promoting the selection of less immunogenic cancer cells. Activated M1 macrophages contribute to antitumor responses, but as the tumor progresses, shift toward M2-like-polarization of TAMs contributing to anti-inflammatory pro-tumorigenic responses. Selection of tumor cells that evade or resist tumor killing cells lead to development of the tumor. Tumor cells can secrete molecules that recruit suppressive cells, including Tregs, which can suppress CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation and activity. The TME can activate pDCs to secrete cytokines that induce the generation of CD8+ Tregs, leading to inhibition of CD4+ T-cells. Binding of PD-1 receptor on T-cells to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells results in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and the host immune response. Antibody blockade of PD-1 and PD-L1 disrupts this tumor escape mechanism, paving the way for development of new therapeutics for MCC.

PMC9857234,Figure 1,"Merkel cell polyomavirus infection and integration. (A) After binding of VP1 to sulfated glycosaminoglycans for initial attachment followed by secondary interaction with sialylated glycans, MCPyV enters cells via caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. Internalized in small endocytic pits the virus is routed via endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum probably necessary for uncoating and translocation into the cytosol. Nuclear entry requires mitotic activity of the host cells [28]. (B) Integration into the host cell genome is not part of the polyomavirus life cycle. However, in a random genetic accident integration of genomic sequences of MCPyV can occur. Errors during the process of the bidirectional virus replication allow rolling circle amplification or double-strand breaks (DSB) and recombination to cause linear defective viral genomes, which may be present as concatemers. After DSB in the host genome, those linear virus genomes can be ligated into the human genome by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (linear integration pattern) or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). The latter will result in amplification of host sequence around the integration site (Z-pattern integration) [31,32].

PMC9857234,Figure 3,"Inhibition of RB1 is the crucial function of truncated LT (tLT). (A) For the growth-promoting function of truncated LT, it requires an intact RB1 binding site, has to interact with HSC70, and has to be phosphorylated at Serine 220 [70,71,72]. This leads to cell cycle progression and expression and activation of several molecules. (B) Another described function of tLT is binding of VAM6P (VPS39), which leads to its sequestration in the nucleus preventing lysosome clustering [73]. (C) tLT and sT induce expression of miRNAs which inhibit autophagy. This function is dependent on the interaction with HSC70 [74].",cancers-15-00444-g003,NotMatch,NotMatch
PMC9857234,Figure 4,"A pleiotropy of functions has been described for sT. (A) Via the SLaP binding domain, sT can recruit the transcription factor L-MYC and its heterodimerization partner MAX to the P400 transcriptional regulatory complex. This leads to (i) a general upregulation of MYC-target genes, (ii) inactivation of p53 by increased expression of MDM2 and the MDM4-activator CK1alpha, (iii) expression of LSD1 and other CoREST complex members which in turn repress expression of ATOH-1- and non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complex-driven expression of genes involved in neuroendocrine differentiation, and (iv) repression of genes involved in HLA class I antigen presentation either directly or through the polyocomb repressive complex 1.1 (PRC1.1) [68,83,84,85]. (B) MCPyV sT is a promiscuous E3 Ligase inhibitor. By interacting with cdc20 homolog 1 (Cdh1; hCdh1) E3 ligase adapter and through the LT stabilizing domain (LSD) with CDC20, cyclin-dependent kinase 1/cyclin B1 (CDK1/CYCB1) is activated which leads to hyperphosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein (4E-BP1) translating into active cap-dependent translation and increased cell mitogenesis. This effect is contributing to the transforming capacity of sT [42,86]. Moreover, through its LSD domain, sT activates non-canonical NFĸB signaling both by inducing increases in NFĸB2 and RELB transcription and also by promoting NFĸB2 stabilization and activation [81]. In this regard, LSD-mediated interaction of MCPyV sT with different E3 ligases, possibly including FBW7, stabilizes a multitude of different proteins [80,87,88]. For example, this interaction stimulates differential expression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes such as MMP-9 and Snail [82]. (C) sT expression can profoundly impact expression of metabolic pathway genes, especially those involved in glycolysis. Indeed, the expression of two glycose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3, and the major monocarboxylate transporter for lactate and pyruvate, MCT1, is increased upon sT expression in fibroblasts [89]. (D) sT impacts cell motility, partially by interacting with PP4C leading to upregulation of stathmin (STMN)-mediated microtubule destabilization as well as to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton mediated by dephosphorylation of β1-integrin [90,91,92]. Moreover, PP4C and sT interaction seems to allow repression of the NFκB essential modulator (NEMO), an adaptor protein inhibiting IκB kinase α (IKKα)/IKKβ-mediated IκB phosphorylation and thus limiting NFκB translocation into the nucleus [93].",cancers-15-00444-g004,NotMatch,NotMatch
PMC9857234,Figure 5,"Of the different strategies tested, so far only the combined expression of T antigens and the transcription factor Atoh1 in a p53-deletion background can trigger MCC formation in a mouse model. Several groups have tested the transforming capacity of especially sT in different mouse models. (A) Transgenic mice that conditionally express MCPyV sT from the ROSA26 locus by expressing Tamoxifen-activatable Cre recombinase either ubiquitously (under the UBC promoter) or specifically under the promoter of Atoh1 encoding the master regulator of Merkel cell development. Outcome in these models depends on time point and dose of tamoxifen administration, resulting in either a temporary increase in Merkel cells, death, or epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis [121]. (B) Similarly, using the Krt14 promotor to express MCPyV T antigens in stratified squamous epithelial cells and Merkel cells of the skin epidermis, causes hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia, but in half of the cases, additionally papilloma. Notably, this phenotype is almost completely prevented in an Rb1ΔLXLC background attenuating LT-Rb interactions through LT’s LXCXE motif [45,138]. (C) In preterm models, Krt5 promoter-driven epidermis-targeted sT expression only caused a phenotype with an intact LT stabilization domain and in combination with Atoh1 expression triggered epidermal tumors displaying MCC markers. Interestingly, additional epidermal expression of truncated LT had no impact on the phenotypes caused by Atoh1 and/or sT [44,127]. (D) Tamoxifen-induced expression of sT in adult mice drives rapid epidermal hyperplasia and development of skin lesions resembling squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ [127].

PMC10242112,Figure 3,"Summary of mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy identified to-date. Several mechanisms can prevent response to immunotherapy altogether (primary resistance), while other mechanisms are acquired later in the disease course and lead to tumor relapse (secondary resistance). (A) Oncoproteins can induce immune suppressive environments that recruit tumor-promoting macrophages and T regulatory cells, prevent infiltration of antigen-presenting cells, and prevent infiltration and priming of effector T cells. (B) Tumor cells can prevent T cell recruitment via downregulation of inflammatory pathways and cell surface integrins (e.g., E-selectin) that mediate T cell entry into inflamed tissues. (C) Tumors often downregulate or develop mutations in genes responsible for antigen presentation (e.g., MHC, IFN-γ receptor), preventing tumor engagement with T cells. (D) Chronic exposure to their cognate antigens leads to activation of evolutionarily protective, immunosuppressive mechanisms that convert effector T cells to a hypofunctional phenotype. (E) Increased glucose uptake by the tumor leads to T cell activation in a nutrient-poor environment, which seems to prime T cells to attain a hyporesponsive phenotype. This phenotype cannot be reversed even if T cells are subsequently stimulated in nutrient-rich conditions. (F) Lack of TLS can prevent appropriate T cell priming and is linked to poor outcomes and poor response to immunotherapy. (G) Cancer and immune cells co-exist in balance with each other. Thus, immune pressure can lead to deletion of immunogenic neoantigens not required for tumor survival. This “hides” the tumor from the immune system. (H) Tumors can also downregulate or mutate cell surface receptors and intracellular proteins responsible for recognizing and responding to immune effector signals (e.g., PTPN2, ADAR1, SETDB1, TBK1, JAK1/2, and PTEN), thus preventing immune-mediated cancer cell death. (I) ICI has been demonstrated to re-invigorate the effector functions of T cells but may not induce memory cell formation.

PMC10468096,Fig 10,"Molecular mechanisms regulating the NCRR-driven transcriptional program of MCPyV.p300/CBP upregulate MCPyV gene expression primarily through acetylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, which binds directly to kB site(s) on the NCRR. p300/CBP may also acetylate the histones associated with the viral NCRR to stimulate MCPyV transcription. In addition to p300/CBP-mediated acetylation, NF-κB activity is also stimulated by MCPyV infection in HDFs. Overstimulation of NF-κB induces the expression of IκBα, which in turn inhibits NF-κB activity through a negative feedback mechanism. The accumulation of NF-κB acetylation within the cell by HDAC inhibition upregulates the p300/CBP-mediated stimulation of viral transcription, while HAT inhibition robustly represses viral transcription downstream of p300/CBP.",ppat.1011598.g010,NotMatch,NotMatch
