Finally, the proliferation index (Ki-67, clone 30-9, rabbit monoclonal, Ventana) was <1%. A diagnosis of an adult-type RM of the vocal cord was made. RMs are rare tumors showing skeletal muscle differentiation, distinguished as of adult (the most common), fetal, or genital type; this classification is usually done according to morphological features, despite there being a site and age predilection for each subtype [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. By definition, genital RMs arise from the genitalia (vagina, vulva, cervix, paratesticular, epididymis, spermatic cord, etc.) of both sexes (8–67 years of age), entering in the differential diagnosis with various benign and malignant tumors [1,5,16,33]; on the other hand, most cases of the other two types arise in the head and neck region (pharynx, larynx, paratracheal, salivary glands, oral cavity, submandibular, soft tissues, etc.) and rarely from extremities or visceral organs (heart, bladder, stomach, etc.), with a slight male predominance [1,2,3,4,6,15,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. The adult-type is the most common form (median age: 60 years; range 33–80 years), and has a male predominance [1,2,3,4,9,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. Fetal RMs frequently occur in the postauricular region of newborns/children and can be associated with basal cell nevus syndrome; this syndrome is caused by PTCH1 mutations, which can activate the hedgehog signaling [1,10,13,32,34,35]. Non-syndromic, fetal or adult RMs may also show activation of this pathway [1,34,35]. Extracardiac RMs have also been associated to Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome (caused by FLCN mutations), while cardiac rhabomyomas frequently occur in the Tuberous Sclerosis setting [1,4,6,7,8,30]. Usually described as slow-growing, painless, soft, and well-circumscribed tumors (size range: 0.5–10 cm; median size: 3 cm), adult RMs are typically benign; however, worrisome features can occur, including fast growth, multifocality (3–15%) (while fetal RMs are usually solitary) or recurrence (10–40%), even in adequately excised tumors [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,34,35]. While adult RMs (as in our case) typically reveal large mature rhabdomyoblasts, with scattered spider cells, fetal RMs usually show irregular bundles of immature skeletal muscle fibers, featuring fetal myotubes (round or spindle cells with occasional cross striations) arranged in a myxoid background [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,34,35]. Fetal RMs can be further grouped into cellular (uniform population of differentiating myoblasts) or myxoid subtypes, depending on the predominant component; mitotic activity can be relatively increased (5/50 mm2), especially in this subtype, in the absence of nuclear atypia, infiltrative margins, atypical mitoses or necrosis [1,10,13,32,35]. In our case, mitoses and nuclear atypia were not found. Female genital RMs are relatively small and contain loose fibrous connective tissue with spindle, polygonal, or elongated rhabdomyoblasts; male genital tumors have histological features of adult or fetal RMs [1,5,16,33]. A granular cell tumor (GCT) was erroneously diagnosed, as the tumor cells, especially at low power, show a granular eosinophilic cytoplasm due to massive accumulation of lysosomes; moreover, typical rod-like inclusions and cross striations were less evident in the previous, partially fragmented specimen. However, the cells of GCTs are usually smaller and less polygonal than those of adult-type RMs; the cell borders are usually ill-defined, sometimes indistinct, and may produce a syncytial appearance. GCT is a rare, frequently benign tumor, frequently arising in the head and neck region (about 50% of cases), especially in the tongue (25% of all cases), while the larynx is less commonly involved (6–10%) [1,36,37,38,39,40]. Other sites include deep dermis/subcutis of trunk (including breast, 5–15%) and proximal extremities, where most of the bona fide malignant cases (50% risk of metastasis) usually occur (especially in thigh) [1,36,37,38,39,40]. Visceral organs (gastro-intestinal tract, etc.) can be involved as well [1,36,37,38,39,40]. Usually solitary, they can be multifocal (10%), also involving different organ sites [1,36,37,38,39,40]. Local recurrence can be seen after incomplete excision; it could also represent an adverse prognostic factor for malignant cases, together with metastatic behavior, larger tumor size, and old age [1]. The head and neck region is less frequently involved with malignant GCTs [36,37,39,40]. GCT patients are usually adults (3rd to 6th decades); the average age of diagnosis for laryngeal GCT is 36 years [1,36,37,38,39,40]. GCTs are generally reactive for S-100, SOX10, nestin, inhibin, calretinin, CD68, CD63 (NKI/C3), and NSE; staining for melan-A is a very rare event (typically focal reactivity), while HMB-45 is usually negative [1,36,40]. Congenital granular cell lesion/epulis is a rare, benign, S-100-negative lesion that is typical of the alveolar ridge (maxilla, mandible) of newborns; the larynx is not a typical site [41,42,43]. The diffuse S-100 positivity of this case was sufficient to support the misleading hypothesis of a GCT, while muscle markers were not performed in the previous specimen. Adult RMs are usually strongly and diffusely positive for desmin, while myogenin and actin can be variably/focally expressed, as in our case [1,2,3,4,9,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. Myoglobin, and MYOD1 can be positive as well [1,2,3,4,9,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. GFAP and S-100 immunohistochemical expression are rarely reported in RMs, typically being focally expressed [1,3,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. To support this consideration, we performed a brief systematic literature review, searching for (S100 OR S-100) AND (rhabdomyoma OR rhabdomyomas) in Pubmed (27 results), Scopus (46 results) and Web of Science (18 results) databases. No limitations were set. Relevant articles were obtained in full-text format and screened for additional references. The bibliographic research ended on February 12, 2022. The main limitations of our review were represented by selection biases and by the possibility that not all the articles investigating S-100 expression in RMs could have been retrieved. However, including our case, S-100 positivity was globally found in 19/34 (56%) adult-type RMs of the head and neck region [3,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. The larger series was that of Kapadia et al. [26], who reported variable (often weak) S-100 positivity in 14/21 (67%) cases (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Dako, 1:1600 dilution). In the remaining four previously reported cases, the positivity was observed in some cells or few scattered nuclei, or it was unclear; the antibody clones were usually not reported [22,28,30,31]. Conversely, S-100 expression was confirmed in >90% of tumor cells in our case, with variable (weak to strong) intensity of staining. Finally, Kapadia et al. [32] reported that also 6/12 (50%) fetal-type RMs of the head and neck region resulted positive for S-100 (1–2+ on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, where 1+ was focal pale positivity); the antibody clone was unclear. These authors additionally specified that 5/6 (83%) cases showed S-100 expression in less differentiated (more primitive-looking), round to oval, mesenchymal cells, while there was diffuse, weak staining of the skeletal muscle fibers in the remaining case; however, it did not reach a 4+ (diffuse, intense) score [32]. Finally, especially on small biopsy material or cytologic samples taken from accessible sites, rare differential diagnoses of RMs may also include: (1) oncocytic tumors (not only oncocytomas) of the salivary glands, usually arising from the parotid, but rarely from minor salivary glands of various sites (including larynx); (2) oncocytic tumors of other origins (such as metastatic renal cell carcinoma); (3) paragangliomas (rarely involving the larynx) [44,45,46,47,48,49,50]. Oncocytomas are composed of tumor cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular to pyknotic nuclei, while paragangliomas show epithelioid, spindle and/or plasmocytoid cells (ovoid nuclei, fine chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli), arranged as single cells or in sheets [44,47,48,49]. Both tumors are typically negative for striated muscle markers, although they may occasionally show S-100 positivity (not typical) [44,47,48,49]. In conclusion, the increasing implementation of various immunohistochemical biomarkers in different tumor contexts has made wider diagnostic immunopanels available for the pathologists’ routine practice. Indeed, proper historical and novel immunostains should be tested without discounts, when indicated, to achieve the correct diagnosis, excluding other relevant differential diagnoses. Moreover, immunomarkers performed to exclude particular hypotheses may reveal unexpected results, helping to consider previously excluded or not evaluated entities. Conversely, the widespread use of inappropriate immunomarkers may result in increasing the diagnostic difficulties, in case of unpredictable results, that cannot be easily managed. The infrequent positivity of some markers in rarely tested tumors (such as S-100 in RMs) may represent misleading diagnostic pitfalls, especially when all the differential diagnoses have not been properly considered [47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64]. Morphology should be accurately evaluated, and a second opinion may be asked.",diagnostics-12-00892-g007
