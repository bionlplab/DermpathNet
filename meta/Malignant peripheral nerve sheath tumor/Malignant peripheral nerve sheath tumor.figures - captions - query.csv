PMC4422082,Figure 2,"(A) Mouse CD44 and RHAMM gene/protein structures in mice. Model structure of alternative splicing in CD44. CD44 pre-mRNA is encoded by 20 exons in mouse and 19 exons in human being. The common standard CD44s (hematopoietic) form contains no extra exons, and the protein has a serine motif encoded in exon 5 that can initiate synthesis of a chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate chain. Alternative splicing of CD44 predominantly involves variable insertion of 10 extra exons with combinations of exons 6–15 and spliced in v1–v10 into the stem region, of which v3 encodes a substitution site for a heparan sulfate chain. Variable numbers of the v exons can be spliced in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and inflammatory monocytes and also are upregulated commonly on neoplastic transformation depending on the tissue. (B) Model structure of alternatively spliced CD44 proteins. The CD44 protein is composed of an extracellular N-terminal domain, a stem region in the extracellular domain close to the transmembrane region, where the variant exon products (red/violet circles) are inserted, the transmembrane region, and the carboxyl terminal cytoplasmic tail. There are multiple sites for N-glycosylation (purple circles) and O-glycosylation (orange circles), and a sulfation domain. The N-terminal portion contains highly conserved disulfide bonds as well as 2 BX7B motifs, both of which are essential for HA binding. CD44 is subjected to extensive glycosylation, sulfation, and attachment of GAGs that contribute to regulation of the HA-binding activity. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail contains several phosphorylation sites that regulate the interaction of CD44 with the cytoskeletal linker proteins, as well as with SRC kinases. (C) RHAMM exon structure. The full-length protein (85 kDa in human beings) is largely associated with microtubule formation during the cell cycle progression. Three isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of exon 4, 5, or 13. Loss of exon 4 disrupts association with microtubules and results in the appearance of RHAMM in the cell nucleus. N-terminal truncations that may be generated by a posttranslational mechanism are constitutively present in some aggressive breast cancer cell lines and tumors. These accumulate in the nucleus and on the cell surface. (D) The secondary structure of RHAMM. RHAMM can self-associate to form random coiled coils (132).",fimmu-06-00201-g002,NotMatch,NotMatch
PMC4422082,Figure 3,"The involvement of HA and CD44 in cell survival and differentiation. (A) Model for the involvement of CD44v6 and Met due to autocrine TGF β1 signaling in lung fibrogenic fibroblasts. The repetitive lung injury in pulmonary fibrosis results in overexpression of TGFβ1 and TGFβ1-induced autocrine signaling that induces a sustained expression of CD44v6 and its co-receptor c-Met. This activates fibrogenic lung fibroblasts with subsequent increased collagen matrix synthesis. Therefore, TGF β1-induced CD44v6 and Met can have a crucial role for the sustained fibrogenic activation of lung fibroblasts. The CD44-phosphorylated ERM complex initiates activation of transforming growth factor-β receptor 1 and 2 (TGFβRI and II) and the downstream SMAD signaling complex, which contribute to fibrosis. (B) Model for involvement of periostin in HA-CD44-mediated cell survival and differentiation. Matricellular protein [periostin (PN)] binding to β1 or β3-integrin activates FAK, which activates downstream MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt to regulate cardiac valve cell growth, survival, differentiation into fibroblasts, and matrix organization (maturation). PN binding to β3-integrin also activates Has2 mRNA expression, Has2 phosphorylation, and HA synthesis. The interaction of HA with CD44, may, in turn, amplify the downstream effects of PN on heart valve cushion cell differentiation/maturation processes. (C) Cleavage of the extracellular domain is accompanied by the cleavage of the intracellular domain (ICD) by the presenilin-γ-secretase complex.

(A) CD44-HA binding, accompanied by activation of CD44-associated SRC, ezrin phosphorylation, and PI3K activation leads to the lipid-raft-integrated assembly of a complex that includes heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), the co-chaperone CDC37, Rho-GEF, Grb2/VAV2, and Gab-1/PI3-kinase (PI3K), which promotes phosphorylation and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including ERBB2, ErbB3, EGFR, IGF1R-β, PDGFR-β, and c-MET. CD44-HA binding initiates cross-talk between RTKs, non-RTKs [SRC (Src)] and linker proteins. Studies have indicated that ErbB2 most likely complexes with CD44 via interactions with Grb2 and Vav2, whereas the interaction of PI3K and CD44 is mediated by Gab-1. PI3K activates Akt and downstream anti-apoptotic events, which contribute to drug resistance. However, HA and PI3K stimulate MDR1 expression, and the stimulatory effects of PI3K would be mainly due to its feedback stimulation of HA production by a positive feedback loop. Studies indicate that MDR1 is associated with CD44 in lipid microdomain and can be linked via CD44 with the actin cytoskeleton so that expression of both CD44 and MDR1 are concomitantly regulated. (B) Particularly, in colorectal cancer, the CD44–ERBB2 complex provides a strong apoptotic resistance through stimulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) transcription via PI3K and β-catenin. COX2-induced PGE2 stimulates HA synthesis and HA-CD44 signaling. CD44v6 also binds hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and presents it to c-MET. Activation of MET and the downstream signaling cascades require sustained activation of CD44-associated phosphorylated ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) and SRC (Src) signaling via the Ras-MAPK and the PI3K-Akt pathway.

Green Track is for extracellular RHAMM signaling involving CD44-HA-mediated pathways. Red track is for intracellular RHAMM signaling. Studies suggest a model for functions of CD44 and RHAMM. The interaction of HA-CD44-RHAMM affects physiological and cellular functions. Cell surface RHAMM interacts with CD44, HA, and growth factor receptors (GFR) to activate protein tyrosine kinase signaling cascades that activate the ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade in a c-Src/Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK1/2 dependent manner (depicted in green track). In the absence of intracellular RHAMM, this signaling can stimulate the transcription of motogenic effectors to regulate a mitogenic response (cell proliferation/random motility). In the presence of intracellular RHAMM (red track), MEK-1/p-Erk1/2 also binds to a number of protein partners that allows activated RHAMM to enter the nucleus to regulate functions of microtubule dynamics via centrosome structure/function, and cell cycle progression via AURKA, a targeting protein for XkIp2 (TPX2).

Left panel shows a schematic diagram for cancer cell internalization of HA conjugated to a drug inhibitor of DNA synthesis. CD44 on the membrane traps the HA-drug conjugate and efficiently internalizes it by endocytosis and forms an endosomal vesicle. This is then transported to the lysosome and fused, and the internalized HA is degraded by hyaluronidase 1 (Hyal-1) into small HA oligosaccharides and then to monosaccharides by lysosomal glycosidases, which ultimately releases the conjugated drug. The drug then goes to the nucleus and inhibits the DNA synthesis. Right panel shows targeting the CD44v6mRNA in cancer cells by CD44v6 shRNA. Plasmids that produce CD44v6 shRNA are coated with transferrin present on the outer surface of the nanoparticles. The transferrin molecules then target the transferrin receptors present in high amounts on the cancer cells. Upon internalization, an endosome forms and the plasmids are released to the nucleus where CD44v6 shRNA is produced by DNA pol III. The shRNA is then exported out of the nucleus by exportin, and the dicer enzyme converts shRNA into CD44v6 siRNA.

PMC7349243,Figure 1,"Signaling pathways altered due to genetic changes observed in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). The most common alterations in MPNST are loss of function of multiple tumor suppressors including NF1, p16/CDKN2A, TP53, and SUZ12/EED. Loss of NF1, as well as epigenetic changes due to loss of PRC2 components, leads to increased signaling through the RAS/RAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Additional molecular events observed in subsets of MPNST include mutations in BRAF, amplification of EGFR or MET receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and changes to chromatin structure through mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X (ATRX) and other epigenetic modifiers.

PMC7317062,Figure 1.,"Neurofibromin is a negative RAS regulator. Growth factor binding to cognate receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, RTK) or chemokine binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) lead to activation of RAS and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream RAS effectors, including AKT (mTOR) and RAF (MEK/ERK). Neurofibromin functions in part as a RAS-GTPase activating-related protein that stimulates inherent GTPase activity of RAS, increasing the conversion of active GTP-RAS to inactive GDP-RAS. Loss of neurofibromin leads to increased RAS/RAF effector activity, and greater cell growth.

PMC8345673,Figure 1,"Targetable pathways in NF1. A plethora of signaling pathways has been implicated in MPNST growth and progression. These pathways include growth signaling pathways, tumor suppressors, pathways that are involved in metabolism and development, and pathways that are involved in angiogenesis and immune responses. Pathways and their targeted drugs are represented schematically in this figure. Loss of NF1 protein leads to the activation of RAS/RAF/MEK and TSC2/mTOR signaling pathways, which support cancer cell proliferation. Dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints, such as CDK2NA and p27, led to abnormal levels of cell cycle kinase CDK4/6 and CDK2, which support cancer cell growth and proliferation. Growth receptor aberrations also contribute to MPNST pathogenesis. Examples of the aberrant receptor signaling that can be targeted are EGFR, c-Met, and PDGFR. Some signaling pathways that are involved in cell development and stemness have been implicated in MPNST development. These are represented by the Wnt and Hippo pathways. Targeting tumor microenvironments is another strategy to treat MPNSTs. Drugs that target the tumor microenvironment include bevacizumab, which targets pro-angiogenic VEGF pathways, and imatinib and pexidatrininb which target mast cells and macrophages, respectively, and play pro-tumorigenic role. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are other examples of drugs in this category.

A qualitative visual assessment of FAP-labeled tissue was performed by pathologists, and a semiquantitative FAP expression score was defined for each tumor. For automated quantitative image analysis using artificial intelligence, digitized slides were stored on a centralized server, and a direct link was established with the Visiopharm Integrator System (VIS) version 6.9.0.2779 (Visiopharm, Hørsholm, Denmark) platform. The first step of digital image analysis was the manual delineation of the regions of interest (ROIs). Each color represents one tissue type that was assessed separately. Automated tissue detection for segmentation and exclusion of artifacts (in gray) was performed. Automated visual detection and quantification of FAP labeling resulted in quantitative output measures. The algorithm for the different brown groups was designed so that it uses a pixel intensity thresholding for the level 1 (FAP-positive cells) weak immunoreactivity of 131–175 pixels; level 2, intermediate immunoreactivity (101–130 pixels); level 3, strong immunoreactivity (71–100 pixel); level 4, very strong immunoreactivity (<71 pixels).
