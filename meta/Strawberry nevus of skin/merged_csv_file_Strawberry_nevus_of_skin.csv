Error bars represent SD+1 (n = 3).(f) Diagram summarizing pathways that are affected in hemangioma. In control endothelial cells, such as HDMEC (left), activation of NFAT and VEGFR1 (R1) expression is controlled by a functional interaction between integrin, the VEGFR2 extracellular domain and TEM8. This results in high levels of VEGFR1 (and COX-2, DSCR-1) and low levels of VEGF-dependent VEGFR2 signaling. In hemEC (right), repressed NFAT activation causes low expression of VEGFR1 (and COX-2, DSCR-1). This results in high level VEGF-mediated signaling through activation of VEGFR2-tyrosine kinase. Consequently, proliferation and migration are upregulated. The effects of mutations in TEM8 and VEGFR2 on VEGFR2 phosphorylation and downstream pathways are indirect and linked to downregulated activation of integrin-NFAT and low VEGFR1 expression. In hemEC4(TEM8), mutant TEM8 has a dominant negative effect on the integrin-NFAT-VEGFR1 pathway. In patient 4 this provides a sufficient genetic explanation for the hemangioma signaling phenotype. The C482R mutation in hemEC2(VEGFR2)/17B(VEGFR2) represents a loss-of-function mutation in the context of VEGFR1 expression, but it does not appear to be sufficient to induce a hemEC-like phenotype when overexpressed in HDMEC. There are two possible reasons; one possibility is that viral expression of mutant VEGFR2 does not reach the required level (in hemEC2 and 17B the ratio between wild-type and mutant protein is 1:1, but this ratio may need to be even more in favor of the mutant in a cell that already expresses two wild-type alleles); a second possibility is that the VEGFR2 mutation is associated with an additional genetic or physiological change to generate the hemangioma cellular phenotype of repressed integrin-NFAT activity and low VEGFR1 expression. In hemEC from patients where we have not yet found mutations, we speculate that their increased β1 integrin/VEGFR2/TEM8 complex formation and reduced integrin/NFAT/VEGFR1 activity is associated with mutations in other, as yet unidentified, cell surface (stippled bars) or cytoplasmic (grey areas with arrows) components of the pathway.",nihms-69200-f0005

In the absence of the β-adrenoceptor blocker a catecholamine-induced stimulation of the β-adrenoceptor activates several signaling pathways, leading to the pathophysiology of IH.

In contrast, propranolol treatment results in inhibition of angiogenesis, stimulation of vasoconstriction, triggering of apoptosis, increase of GJIC, and prevention of cell proliferation via blockade of these β-adrenoceptor-mediated pathways, and thus leading to regression of IHs.

Angiogenic sprouts emerge from the newly formed vessels in response to pro-angiogenic cues, such as hypoxia-induced VEGF. VEGF stimulus, acting via VEGFR-2, increases the expression of Dll4 on endothelial cells, which in turn activates Notch receptors on adjacent endothelial cells. Furthermore, VEGFRs are regulated by Notch signaling, providing an additional feedback loop between the two pathways: activated Notch receptors on ECs can positively regulate the expression of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-3 in those cells. In contrast, Notch activation leads to the reduction of VEGFR-2 expression in cell culture and a concomitant decrease in the proangiogenic response to exogenous VEGF. Both of these effects would likely lead to a lower migratory or proliferative response in connector cells that exhibit Notch activation.",1756-8722-7-13-4

IH is caused by aberrantly displaced/embolized placental chorionic villous mensenchymal core cells into the fetus proper, which gives rise to a primitive mesoderm-derived hemogenic endothelium with a neural crest phenotype regulated by the RAS. This hemogenic endothelium differentiates into stem cells of neuro-glial, mesenchymal, endothelial, and hematopoietic lineages with downstream mesenchymal and erythropoetic and potentially myeloid differentiation capabilities. During the proliferative phase of IH, high levels of renin indirectly lead to high levels of ATII resulting in aberrant proliferation of the hemogenic endothelium and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from the accumulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), both leading to proliferation of the endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and downstream endothelial cells (ECs). High levels of ATII also lead to over-expression of the TRAIL decoy receptor, osteoprotogerin (OPG) preventing apoptosis of the hemogenic endothelium, MSCs, and EPCs, with further proliferation and accumulation of these cellular elements and ECs. High levels of ATII also prevent terminal differentiation of MSCs to downstream adipocytes, further increasing the accumulation of MSCs. During the involuting phase of IH, reduced levels of ATII indirectly caused by decreasing levels of renin, ease accumulation of EPCs and ECs. Reduced levels of ATII also allow termination differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes resulting in a fibro-fatty residuum. Inhibition of renin by β-blockers or ACEi leads to reduced levels of ATII resulting in accelerated involution of IH.

Methylation occurs only on the paternal chromosome for CTCF BS6. In normal tissue, such as patient matched control blood, this assay is capable of isolating the genotype of the paternal chromosome. As thymidine cannot be methylated, those individuals with a paternal T at rs10732516 were not methylated at CpG#5. Paternal C carrying individuals were methylated at CpG#5.

Under physiological conditions, corresponding to 10 to 100 VEGFR-2 molcules per square micron, 30 to 60% of the receptors are dimeric. The dimers are stabilized by homotypic contacts in D4-7 in the EC domain, TM interactions that involve amino acids E764, T771, and/or F778, and contacts between the intracellular domains. The EC domain, as a whole, inhibits dimerization. The ligand-free dimers are phosphorylated, to a low degree. (B) Ligand binding induces a rotation in the TM helices and the formation of a different TM dimer configuration, such that amino acids E764, T771, and F778 now face the lipid membrane, away from the TM dimer interface. These structural changes increase the separation between the C-termini of the TM helices, promoting an increase in receptor phosphorylation and activation. Contacts between D4 and D7 persist in the ligand-bound state.DOI:

Activation of adrenergic receptors decreases infiltration by cytotoxic T-cells, increases the number of regulatory T-cells, and increases the recruitment and differentiation of tumor-associated macrophages. Sympathetic signaling also increases the migration and proliferation of normal ECs. In tumor cells, adrenergic signaling stimulates production of other proangiogenic and inflammatory mediators such as HIF-1α, VEGF, and IL-6 and suppresses the DNA damage response.

Upon the different stimuli, monocytes tend to differentiate into M1 or M2 macrophages via different signaling pathways. In most vascular inflammatory diseases, M1 activation is dominant, whereas M2 activation is relatively inhibited. Through activation of the pathways (JAK/STAT1, IRF/STAT1, and MyD88/NF-κB), activated M1 macrophages release various inflammatory mediators, such as MHC-II, chemokines (CXCL10 and CXCL11), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27), to encourage the activation of Th1/Th17 cells and trigger Th1/Th17 response. Apart from that, M1 macrophages produce substantial ROS and NO. As the key factors that regulate the differentiation and chemotaxis of Th2/Treg cells, however, M2-secreted chemokines (CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, and CCL24) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10) markedly decrease along with the inhibition of activated M2. As a result, these events may contribute to the appearance of T cell dysregulation, OS damage, and increased inflammatory mediators in the pathological process of vascular inflammatory disorders or dermatoses, e.g., psoriasis, SLE, and BD. On the other hand, activated M2 macrophages secrete abundant angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF-A/C, FGF-2, EGF, and PDGF) via stimulating the JAK/STAT6 and IL-10/STAT3 pathways, which not only facilitate normal angiogenesis in wound repair but also promote abnormal angiogenesis in angiogenesis-related diseases including IH by activating the PDGF and FGF signal pathways.

In the classical RAS (blue), angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin I (ATI) by renin. ATI is converted to angiotensin II (ATII) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ATII is the main effector for the RAS that binds to ATII receptor 1 (AT1R) and ATII receptor 2 (AT2R) to exert its physiological effects. Angiotensin 1–7 (Ang1–7) is a cleavage product of ATII which binds to the G protein–coupled receptor Mas receptor (MasR), which in turn exerts physiological effects. Ang1–7 is converted to alamandine by decarboxylation, which acts on Mas-related-G protein coupled receptors (MrgDs). ATII is converted to angiotensin III (ATIII) by aminopeptidase A, and ATIII is converted to angiotensin IV (ATIV) by aminopeptidases. ATII and ATIII bind to both AT1R and AT2R. Proteases including cathepsins B, D, and G, and chymase constitute bypass loops of the RAS (red), providing redundancies to this system. Other signaling pathways converge on the RAS (green) with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway being upstream of the RAS, activated by (pro)renin receptor.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the microenvironmental niche with complex interactions with the immune system/inflammation, vitamin D, vitamin D deficiency (VDD), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and hypertension. VDD which is caused by reduced sunlight/UVB radiation, and leads to increased RAS activity and the resultant hypertension. VDD also directly leads to hypertension. Increased RAS activity also activates the immune system. The complex interactions between these elements lead to activation of various pro-fibroproliferative signaling pathways leading to generation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Hypertension has a direct pro-fibroproliferative effect and contributes to the conducive microenvironment for the ESC-like cells within the KALTs. VDD increases RAS activity, with activation of the immune system/inflammation leading to an altered microenvironmental niche via the IL-6 and IL-17 axis. This increased RAS activity activates TGF-β/Smad signaling to promote EndoMT. Binding of vitamin D to VDR results in a genomic effect which counteracts the pro-fibroproliferative signaling pathways. VDR transcriptional activity inhibits keloid fibroblast proliferation.

NGBR is a transmembrane protein. NGBR promotes the migration and proliferation of HemSCs by activating the Ras signaling pathway. NGBR acts as a Ras regulator in controlling the growth and differentiation of HemSCs. NGBR activates multiple downstream signaling pathways to promote angiogenesis and migration by activating Ras in HemSCs. NGBR also promotes the cell cycle and ultimately angiogenesis. The three important signaling pathways are as follows: (1) After activating Ras, NGBR further activates the Raf/ERK/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, promotes nuclear gene expression, promotes cell proliferation and migration, and promotes G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle. (2) NGBR activates the Ras/PI3K/PAK/MEKK1 signaling pathway to promote cell proliferation and migration. (3) NGBR can also activate the AKT/ERK/P53/p21 signaling pathway, promote cell proliferation and migration, and thus promote angiogenesis. In addition, several important growth factors (VEGF, PDGF, FGF2, and EGF) promote cell proliferation and migration by binding to their respective RTK receptors to activate protein tyrosine kinase activity within the receptors, which then activates Ras and Ras-dependent signal transduction cascades in the cell membrane. NGBR regulates the Ras signaling pathway, while PTK growth factors activate HemSC proliferation and migration. Ras, as a core gene in the NGBR pathway, plays an important role in promoting vascular growth.

VEGF-A promotes angiogenesis by activating the VEGFR-2 receptor in HemECs by triggering multiple downstream signaling pathways, including microvascular permeability, HemEC proliferation, migration, and survival. Activation of VEGFR-2 in HemECs triggers multiple downstream signals that promote angiogenesis. These pathways are as follows: (1) VEGFR-2 activates mitogen-activated protein/Ras/Raf1/ERK/MEK signaling pathways, which promote HemEC proliferation and thus promote angiogenesis. (2) The activation of the PI3K/serine-threonine protein kinase/Akt signaling pathway by VEGFR-2 promotes cell survival. VEGFR-2 also activates the Akt/mTOR/HIF-1/Gult-1/Glucose-1 signaling pathway and increases glycolysis to promote HemEC proliferation and thus promote angiogenesis. PI3K/Akt activation can promote the expression of Bcl-2 and play an anti-apoptotic role to promote cell survival. (3) VEGFR-2 can directly promote angiogenesis by activating the MKK/p38/MAPK/HSP27 signaling pathway and affecting intracellular actin recombination. (4) The VEGFR-2 receptor directly activates FAK/Paxillin to promote cell migration and thus generate neovascularization. These signaling pathways play different cellular biological functions but also have synergistic effects on each other to promote the generation of neovascularization.
