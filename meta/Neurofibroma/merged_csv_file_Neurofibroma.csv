Postcontrast axial (c) and coronal (d) T1-weighted images with fat saturation better demonstrate the enhancing soft-tissue mass and its extension. The mass invades the medial orbit, displacing the right medial rectus laterally (black arrow), and causes proptosis (star). On coronal, the mass is again seen invading the adjacent sinuses and obstructing the nasal passage; however, unlike CT, abnormal enhancement is seen of the frontal dura (white arrows). The dural thickening and enhancement are compatible with direct tumor invasion. These findings were highly concerning for rhabdomyosarcoma.

The prerequisite for the simplified presentation is a monogenic disease. The figures are slightly modified taking into account PNST in NF1. From left to right: in healthy individuals, both alleles relevant for the disease of interest are wildtype (white body). In an autosomal dominant hereditary disease such as NF1, an affected individual will carry the constitutional mutation in every single cell (gray body). Postzygotic mutation of one allele in a certain body region causes a heterozygous status in an otherwise healthy organism (light gray belt in white body): this status was also detected in individual cases for certain skin manifestations in NF1 gene [101] and diagnosed as a “segmental type 1 manifestation” [77]. Tumors such as (plexiform) neurofibroma in an individual affected with NF1 are explained as the result of a second mutation at the NF1 gene in all tumor cells of the localized lesion: loss of heterozygosity (LOH, dark gray belt in light gray body). When this genetic event affects the skin, there is a “segmental type 2 manifestation” of this autosomal dominant trait [77]. The LOH appears to happen by chance [81], [83]. The time of mutation (ontogenesis, postnatal) is relevant for histological type of tumor and is crucial for tumor phenotype, e.g. on the upper limb. In rare cases, both alleles are mutated but these events are restricted to a body region or body segment. In this situation, a PNF can develop in a patient without meeting the clinical NF1 criteria when both mutated alleles of NF1 have occurred in Schwann cells or Schwann cell progenitors (dark gray belt in white body). In principle, the above described distribution patterns of genetic events in a tumor suppressor gene causing an autosomal dominant inherited disease can all appear without skin involvement [79]. However, the pivotal involvement of the skin, bone and the nervous system in the genetic condition termed “NF1” are well established [1].",IPRS-06-15-g-019

A schematic diagram depicts major intracellular pathways regulated by merlin, the protein product of the NF2 gene. Merlin is associated with the plasma membrane via its N-terminal FERM domain, where it interacts with adherens junctions and numerous cell surface receptors including integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), and CD44. The C-terminal domain of merlin interacts with cytoskeletal actin filaments. Merlin has a predominantly inhibitory activity on downstream effectors including RAS, PI3K, RAC, and SRC, which may result in reduced downstream RAF/MEF/ERK, AKT/JNK/JUN, mTORC1, FAK, and RAC signaling. Merlin may inhibit translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus, reducing the output of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Merlin also interacts with the Hippo pathway by promoting MST1/2-mediated translocation of LATS1/2 to the nucleus as well as through inhibition of CRL4DCAF1, resulting in reduced transcriptional output of YAP/TAZ and TEA domain transcription factors (TEADs). In the nucleus, merlin may also inhibit the activity of LIN28A, thereby relieving inhibition of the let-7 miRNA cluster leading to downregulation of proto-oncogenic proteins such as MYC and RAS. Loss of function of merlin via pathogenic mutations in NF2 patients results in alteration of downstream activity in each of these pathways (red arrows indicate steps with possible increased activity following loss of merlin function, as in NF2-associated tumors), potentially leading to increased cell growth, protein and fatty acid synthesis, proliferation, and survival. A variety of therapeutic avenues have been explored in NF2 patients, including inhibition of proteins regulated by merlin as well as other cellular receptors. Inhibition of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway via small molecule MEK inhibitors is currently being explored in clinical trials for NF2-associated tumors (NCT02639546, NCT03095248). A phase 2 clinical trial is exploring small molecule inhibition of FAK by GSK2256098 (NCT02523014/A071401) in NF2 mutant meningiomas. Small molecule mTOR inhibitors including everolimus and sirolimus have shown therapeutic promise in NF2-associated schwannomas and meningiomas, and additional compounds including RAD001 and AZD2014 are in clinical trials for the treatment of progressive/symptomatic NF2-associated meningiomas (NCT02831257) and recurrent high-grade (WHO grade II/III) meningiomas (NCT03071874), respectively. The VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab has shown clinical utility in NF2-associated schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. Inhibition of the tyrosine kinase receptors cMET and EGFR may provide additional therapeutic opportunities in NF2-associated meningiomas. Additional therapeutic targets have been proposed, including the immunomodulatory PD-1/PD-L1 axis, the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and Ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2)",401_2019_2029_Fig1_HTML

Schwannomas typically exhibit intense gadolinium contrast enhancement (c–d).

Varying hypercellular and hypocellular regions may correlate with the heterogeneous intensity of schwannomas on T2-weighted sequences (b).

The stem cell model of tumorigenesis has three separate but related components. The first component concerns whether tumors arise from tissue adult stem cells or their immediate progenitors. These tumor cells of origin are cells that acquire first genetic mutation or loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The second component concerns tumor initiation cells which are cells that undergo the initial expansion secondary to further genetic changes or external signals from the microenvironment. It is entirely possible that in some instances, the tumor cells of origin and the tumor initiation cells are the same cell type. The third component of the stem cell model of tumorigenesis is that tumors are sustained and driven by a small population of cells with stem cell properties, termed cancer, or tumor stem cells.",vdz044f0001

A plethora of signaling pathways has been implicated in MPNST growth and progression. These pathways include growth signaling pathways, tumor suppressors, pathways that are involved in metabolism and development, and pathways that are involved in angiogenesis and immune responses. Pathways and their targeted drugs are represented schematically in this figure. Loss of NF1 protein leads to the activation of RAS/RAF/MEK and TSC2/mTOR signaling pathways, which support cancer cell proliferation. Dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints, such as CDK2NA and p27, led to abnormal levels of cell cycle kinase CDK4/6 and CDK2, which support cancer cell growth and proliferation. Growth receptor aberrations also contribute to MPNST pathogenesis. Examples of the aberrant receptor signaling that can be targeted are EGFR, c-Met, and PDGFR. Some signaling pathways that are involved in cell development and stemness have been implicated in MPNST development. These are represented by the Wnt and Hippo pathways. Targeting tumor microenvironments is another strategy to treat MPNSTs. Drugs that target the tumor microenvironment include bevacizumab, which targets pro-angiogenic VEGF pathways, and imatinib and pexidatrininb which target mast cells and macrophages, respectively, and play pro-tumorigenic role. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are other examples of drugs in this category. Other targets that are represented are involved in metabolism (glutaminase), epigenetic (BRD4), and ER stress (Hsp90).",cancers-13-03880-g001

First, visual experience (light)-induced activity enhances RGC production of soluble-Nlgn3 (s-Nlgn3), which drives OPG initiation and cell growth. Second, tumor-associated NF1-mutant RGCs have increased intrinsic baseline neuronal hyperexcitability, which is controlled by HCN channel function.
