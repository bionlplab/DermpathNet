PMC9995550,Figure 1.,"AThe chest x-ray indicated an enlarged heart. B: TTE revealed there was a mass on the pulmonary artery. C: 3D echocardiography reflected the mass in the pulmonary artery. D: Color Doppler flow imaging showed a filling defect in the pulmonary artery at the mass. E: The peak velocity and pressure gradient of blood flow in stenosis were measured by continuous Doppler. F: Contrast echocardiography displayed almost no contrast medium enhancement in the interior of the mass and a little enhancement in the base of the mass. G and H: MRI demonstrated a mass located in the pulmonary artery with an uneven high signal enhancement pattern on late gadolinium-enhanced images. I: The section of the gross specimen is gray-white and gray-red jelly. J: Histological examination showed a large number of spindle cells and microvessels. K and L: Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of vascular endothelial cytokines was positive. 3D, three dimensional; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; TTE, transthoracic echocardiography.",ajc-27-3-E-9_f001,NotMatch,NotMatch
