Figure presents the most common dermoscopic patterns with selected dermoscopic features of halo nevus in investigated patients’ group. A – Uniform globular pattern in brown with a typical surrounding depigmented whitish halo. B – Structureless pattern in brown-white. C – Blue granules and a rest of network pattern of clinically disappearing halo nevus. D – Cobblestone pattern with several central serpiginous vessels. E – Halo nevus with circumflexing linear vessels like a “vascular crown”. There is seen a very sharply demarcated rim in slight pinkish in contrast with normal skin in light-brown. F – Halo nevus with circumflexing linear vessels like a “vascular crown” and several serpiginous vessels inside the nevus.
