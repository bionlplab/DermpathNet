Note the surface mucosal erosion. (B) The majority of the mass is infiltrated by signet ring carcinoma cells, and poorly differentiated mucinous glands are floating in the mucin pool. Inset indicates high magnification of signet ring cells showing intracytoplasmic mucin compressing the hyperchromatic nuclei to the periphery. (C) The transformation zone of the anal canal shows infiltration of multifocal signet ring cell carcinoma (white arrows) and a focus of atypical gland beneath the mucosa (black arrow). Inset shows adenocarcinoma in situ with a gland having enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei with coarse chromatin and increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. (D) Large Paget cells showing clear cytoplasm with eccentric hyperchromic nuclei are located along the basal layer of the squamous epithelium. Inset indicates Paget cells in the epidermis.",jptm-2015-08-08f3
