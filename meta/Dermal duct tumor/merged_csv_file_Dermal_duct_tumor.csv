The basal keratinocytes of the sweat duct ridge and lower intraepidermal acrosyringium are thought to give rise to poroid neoplasms based on the similarities in keratin expression [6,10]. K5 and K14 expression is ubiquitous throughout poromas, while K1 and K10 are found in focal aggregates. K77 is restricted to normal luminal cells embedded within the tumors.",dermatopathology-09-00007-g001
