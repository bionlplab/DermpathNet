PMC10359696,Figure 2,"(case 8) An 84-year-old man had a 36mm max diameter ceruminous pleomorphic adenoma in the right EAC protruding out from the EAC and extending to the parotid (behind the mass, cholesteatoma was found in the EAC). CT: (A, B) calcified foci (black arrow) and heterogenous enhancement in the tumor. MRI (C-F):T1 low intensity (C), T2 intermediate and high signal intensity (D), DWI intermediate signal intensity (E) (behind the mass, cholesteatoma appeared as high intensity); the mass showed edge enhancement (black arrow) and was adjacent to the parotid (star) on coronal enhanced T1 (F). The mass is a lobulated solid mass on the gross appearance (G).",fonc-13-1041282-g002,NotMatch,NotMatch

(A) (case 5) Ceruminous gland adenoma of the external auditory canal, evaluation with hematoxylin-eosin staining. The neoplastic proliferation of ceruminous glands is visible. The glandular epithelium is bilayered. Abundant cytoplasm is seen in the luminal cells, which show focal decapitation secretion and contain ceroid pigment (40x). (B) (case 8) Histological findings of ceruminous pleomorphic adenoma of the EAC showing the glandular epithelial component and myxofirous stroma(40x). (C) (case 9) Ceruminous syringocystadenoma papilliferum of the external auditory canal, evaluation with hematoxylin-eosin staining.
