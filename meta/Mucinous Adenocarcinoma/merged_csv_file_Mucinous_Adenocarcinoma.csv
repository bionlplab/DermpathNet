Right panel, likewise, 28 genes highly correlated with VTCN1 in the TCGA LUAD cases (n = 230; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014) were expressed in human IMA but only 1 gene highly correlated with PD‐L1 was expressed in human IMA.

A549 cells were infected with Nkx2‐1‐expressing lentivirus as previously reported (Maeda et al, 2012). ChIP‐seq indicates that NKX2‐1 bound to the locus of PD‐L1 and PD‐L2.
PD‐L1 and PD‐L2 mRNAs were significantly induced by NKX2‐1. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM of biological triplicates for each group.

A Middle section of the esophagus (approximately 30 cm from incisors). When entering the patient’s lower esophagus-cardia entrance (approximately 40 cm from incisors) (B), at this time, we had not found a tumor yet with sufficient steam injection. However, we failed to fully expose the squamous and columnar epithelial junction (SCJ). We turned the gastroscope over to look at the lesser curvature and found the lesion. First, gastric fundus dilation with sufficient gas injection was limited. Then, as shown in C, we found a bleeding spot in the cardia. Through closer observation, we found a lesion in form of a growing ring around the cardia. Because of its contraction, the stomach cavity was narrowed, similar to a gourd neck. The demarcation line (DL) of the lesion was clear, and as it was growing along the lesser curvature distally, the upper part of the stomach was also affected. Its mucosa was rough, protuberant, with spontaneous bleeding and prone to bleeding when touched by the endoscope. Surface structure was similar to papillary and granular. We did not see any obvious erosion, ulcer, or secretion. As shown in D, it seems to be a submucosal tumor with inflammatory changes in the surface mucosa.

The tumor grew with a corrugated structure, and showed an expansive growth pattern, with no invasive growth. A partly mucoid reticulum was also observed. Tumor cells were pseudostratified and had short spindle-shaped nuclei. Tumor cell atypia was weak and the histopathological diagnosis was low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. The resection was negative, and no lymph node metastasis was observed.",cureus-0015-00000043024-i06
