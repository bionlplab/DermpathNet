In the U6-LoxPshBCCIP construct, the U6 promoter that normally drives expression of shRNA is nonfunctional due to insertion of a LoxPNeoLoxP cassette, which can be “popped out” by expression of Cre recombinase. This allows the U6 promoter to reconstitute its activity, leading to the expression of the anti-BCCIP shRNA. b The hK14-Cre transgene and the LoxPshBCCIP cassette were detected in genomic DNA isolated from mammary gland tissue (top and center). PCR amplification of the recombined shBCCIP-expressing cassette was only detected in animals positive for the Cre-recombinase transgene (bottom). c Serial sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were stained to assess BCCIP levels and corresponding Cre-recombinase expression in the mammary epithelium.
