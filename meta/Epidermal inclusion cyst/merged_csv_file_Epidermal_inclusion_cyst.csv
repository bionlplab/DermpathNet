Routine mammography was performed and this showed two well-defined nodular densities in left upper central quadrant. C, D. Breast US was performed on first visit three years previously (C).

As compared to previous US, current breast US (D) shows presence of masses that have apparently increased in size in skin and subcutaneous layer. Maximum diameter of masses had increased from 9 to 17 mm and from 8 to 9 mm. More importantly, three masses are surrounded by echogenic lines (white arrows) that represent dermal layer.
