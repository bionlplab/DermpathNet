First, the data is normalized using the Bioconductor software. Then ANOVA is used to identify those genes that are differentially expressed in at least one tumor subtype; we use a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of less than 0.01. Afterwards, the expression of each differentially expressed gene is averaged across all samples of each subtype. Those average expression levels are then used to compute the distance matrix of the subtypes, which is in turn utilized to construct a phylogenetic tree using the Phylip or FastME software. To determine the consensus tree, the phylogenetic construction is repeated 10,000 times using different sets of differentially expressed genes (of varying number).

We showed that in myxoid liposarcoma, the atypical NF-kappaB pathway is active. Hereby casein kinase 2 phosphorylates the nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor (IkB), which releases from the NF-kappaB p50/p65 complex and gets degraded. The NF-kappaB p50/p65 complex then shuttles into the nucleus were it promotes the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation. Recent studies showed that the FUS/DDIT3 protein facilitates DNA binding of the NF-kappaB p50/p65 complex in a non-direct manner, probably by interfering with IkB. Also Src pathway is activated in myxoid liposarcoma, which leads through different signaling pathways (AKT, MEK, ERK) to tumor growth and cell survival.

Under resting conditions, NF-κB is maintained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm via interaction with the inhibitory protein, IκB. Doxorubicin can activate the NF-κB pathway, which involves the phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of IκB. Nuclear factor-κB is then free to translocate to the nucleus where it facilitates the transcription of, for example, antiapoptotic genes, resulting in less tumour cell killing and the development of drug resistance. MonoHER is able to reduce this doxorubicin-induced NF-κB activation, thereby sensitising WLS-160 cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.",6606065f2

Dormant tumors are formed after s.c. injection of tumor cells in immunocompromised mice and remain undetectable by gross examination for a prolonged period of time. This dormancy period is characterized by impaired tumor angiogenesis and high levels of cell turnover, i.e., balanced tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Tumors spontaneously exit the dormancy phase and switch to a rapid “angiogenic” growth. Differential regulation of miRs in dormant vs. fast-growing tumors (B). 19 miRs were significantly differentially regulated during the switch of dormant tumors to fast-growth in all four dormancy models (p<0.03). The prevailing regulation pattern was the loss of dormancy associated miRs (DmiRs) after the switch of dormant tumors. The heatmap represents fold expression values of miRs in dormant vs. fast-growing tumors according to the scale bar. Red: miRs upregulated in dormant tumors. Green: miRs down-regulated in dormant tumors. MiRs are sorted by hierarchical clustering. The expression level of miR-580, miR-588 and miR-190 was detected in human glioma specimens (C–E).

Average tumor volume of parental tumor (labeled in red line) n = 11, cells infected with GFP only control vector (n = 9), miR-580 (n = 5), miR-588 (n = 4), and miR-190 (n = 5) expressing A-GBM tumors. Kaplan-Meier analysis of tumor free survival (B). The criterion for “tumor free” was defined as mice bearing no detectable tumors by gross examination or tumors with volume smaller than 50 mm3. The median tumor free survival was markedly increased in miR-580 and miR-588 expressing tumors as compared to the GFP control. 60% of miR-190 expressing tumors remained dormant for the whole observation period. Statistical significance was reached for miR-190 (p<0.03) and miR-580 (p = 0.05), respectively, by log-rank test. The dormancy promoting effect of DmiRs was not attributed to impaired proliferation kinetic or enhanced apoptosis of DmiR expressing tumor cells in-vitro (C). In contrast, there was a trend towards higher proliferation rates and reduced apoptosis in miR-580 expressing cells (C). Proliferating tumor cells were also detected by Ki67 immunohistochemistry and representative photomicrographs are shown (D) in dormant miR-588 expressing GBMs (107days post implantation) and fast-growing GFP expressing control tumors (day 113 after implantation). In-vivo proliferation index was determined by counting the fraction of Ki67+ tumor cells.

A small population of proliferating cells arises from a hypothetical tumor stem cell population. Most of these cells enter senescence and a few percent differentiates into lipoblasts. RB1 and RBL2 proteins are central factors involved in growth regulation and entry/maintenance of cell senescence. RB1 is expressed in proliferating cells and is also necessary for differentiation and senescence. RBL2 is expressed in resting and senescent cells.

YY1 immunostaining shows faintly immunolabelled nuclei in the ML samples (A) and strong nuclear decoration in the RC samples involving the overwhelming majority of enriched tumoral cells (B). The results of the WB experiments were consistent with immunohistochemical results (C) Explanatory diagram of YY1 interactions. (D) The proposed model envisages mechanistic interactions between proteins and the promoters of the fast cell cycle/pluripotency/differentiation genes involved in MLS tumour progression. YY1 can activate (left) or repress (right) the transcription of its target genes. Left: Gene switch-on driven by YY1. YY1 triggers gene expression (“ON” genes) by recruiting histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP, which promote the histone acetylation and protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT 1 that lead to methylation at Arg3 of histone H4. The result is a high level of transcription activity supported by the hyper-acetylated and tri-methylated promoters shared by YY1 and c-MYC that leads to c-MYC network activation [32] involving fast cell cycle/pluripotency genes. Moreover, as c-MYC and HDAC2 play a mutually positive regulatory role, HDAC2 may activate c-MYC, thus making it a possible pharmacological target. TRIM71 is a downstream target that correlates significantly with YY1 (see Figure S3, described below). Right: Gene switch-off driven by YY1. PRC2 suppresses gene expression (“OFF” genes) by promoting histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and HDAC2 contributes to gene silencing by deacetylating histone. YY1 and HDAC2 physically interact and respectively bind PRC2 via Ezh2 and EED [28]. The result is silencing mediated by the deacetylation and tri-methylation of the promoters of the target genes involved in differentiation and fast cell cycle inhibition. Epigenetic modifications imposed by YY1, HDAC2 and c-MYC. (E) After each division, the fate of poised cells (translocation-carrying cells) is defined by genes targeted by the annotated proteins (YY1, HDAC2, c-MYC), which ensure progression to RC by means of protein-specific interplays that favour the repression or activation of the targeted genes in cooperation with chromatin-modifying complexes (thick arrow) of chromatin regulators (polycomb, trithorax, HDAC, HAC) and chromatin markers (H3K27, H3K4, histone deacetylation, histone acetylation). Polycomb and HDAC respectively induce gene silencing by means of H3K27 tri-methylation and histone deacetylation, whereas trithorax and HAC respectively trigger gene activation by means of H3K4 tri-methylation and histone acetylation. Cumulatively, the progression to RC is dictated by the enrichment of activated fast cell cycle/stemness genes and the silencing of differentiation/slow cell cycle genes.",oncotarget-05-5965-g003

(a) FUS binds the promoters of >1,000 genes, indicative of a role in transcriptional regulation. (b) FUS binds both single- and double-stranded DNA and is important for two critical steps in homologous recombination: D-loop formation and homologous DNA pairing. When a double-strand break occurs in DNA, the 5′ end of the break is trimmed back to create a 3′ overhang of single-stranded DNA. This 3′ single-stranded DNA then binds a complementary sequence within duplex DNA of a homologous chromosome or sister chromatid, a process called strand invasion (reviewed in X. Li & Heyer, 2008). (c) FUS binds G-quadruplexes in telomeres. (d) Analogous to the role of FUS in D-loop formation, FUS may also be important for T-loop formation at the ends of telomeres. T-loops are formed when a single-stranded, G-rich DNA overhang at the end of a chromosome forms a loop and anneals to a complementary 5′ C-rich sequence (Griffith et al., 1999; reviewed in Greider, 1999).",10.1177_1759091414544472-fig2

Under normal conditions, FUS (green oval) and common repair proteins (triangles) localize to sites of laser-induced DNA damage (yellow star). Under conditions of FUS knockdown, these repair proteins are not recruited to sites of DNA damage and the efficiency of both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining is reduced. Mutant FUS (red ovals) is still able to localize to sites of damage in the absence of endogenous FUS (**discrepancy in the literature for the degree of localization of variant R521G). Exogenous mutant FUS does not fully rescue DNA-damage repair when endogenous FUS is knocked-down (*exception, FUS H517Q), although mutant FUS is able to recover NHEJ to a greater extent than HR (*NHEJ is fully recovered by FUS H517Q).

Cells expressing exogenous WT or endogenous FUS (top panels) and ALS-linked mutant FUS (bottom panels) are shown under different cellular conditions. (a) Under normal conditions, WT/endogenous FUS is localized predominantly to the nucleus while ALS-FUS variants with mutations in the nuclear localization domain undergo varying degrees of cytoplasmic mislocalization. (b) Under conditions of oxidative stress, heat shock, or ER stress, WT/endogenous FUS remains nuclear while mutant FUS that is already mislocalized to the cytoplasm incorporates into stress granules. (c) Under conditions of hyperosmolar stress, WT/endogenous FUS translocates to the cytoplasm and incorporates into stress granules. Under these conditions, endogenous FUS is thought to play a prosurvival role.

28273913,PMC5428330,ALS-linked FUS exerts a gain of toxic function involving aberrant p38 MAPK activation.,Sci Rep,2023-12-17-21-58-15,Figure 7,"Model for aberrant activation of p38 MAP kinase(s) by mutant and misfolded ALS-associated proteins. Available data (from this study and others10, 12, 20) support a model whereby mutant and misfolded forms of FUS (mFUS; left) and SOD1 (mSOD1; right) induce the aberrant activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Hsp110 likely synergizes with other chaperones to ameliorate the effects of mSOD1 and mFUS, possibly upstream of ASK1 and additional unidentified factors. While mSOD1 and mFUS converge on p38 MAPK activation, perfusion of these proteins into squid axoplasm have differential effects on FAT; mFUS inhibits both anterograde (←) and retrograde (→) FAT (Figs 1 and 2) whereas mSOD1 only inhibits anterograde FAT10, 12, 20, consistent with inhibition of the beta and alpha isoforms of P38 MAPK, respectively12. In addition to FAT inhibition in squid (solid lines), mFUS- and mSOD1-induced activation p38 MAPK can manifest different phenotypes in mammalian systems (dashed lines), including but not limited to inhibition of axon outgrowth (Fig. 4) and enhanced susceptibility to cell stress12.

Ascorbate auto-oxidation, either extracellular or intracellular, generates H2O2 that can freely diffuse into sarcoma cells to increase cellular DNA damage in combination with radiation- or gemcitabine-mediated DNA damage. (Left) Ionizing radiation causes DNA damage through both direct oxidation of DNA macromolecules (direct effect) or through initiation of free radical mechanism resulting from the radiolysis of water (indirect effect; multistep process represented by dotted line). The resulting H2O2 from the radiolysis of water and the oxidation of ascorbate can react with redox-active labile iron weakly chelated by DNA to produce site-directed DNA damage via Fenton-chemistry catalyzed hydroxyl radical (•OH) production or via•OH produced directly through the radiolysis of water. (Right) Gemcitabine induces DNA damage through a variety of proposed mechanisms, including, but not limited to the major mechanism as a nucleoside analog, stalling DNA replication after incorporation into a new DNA strand (red), and inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase.

A common characteristic of WDLS, DDLS, and PLS is amplifications in HMGA2, MDM2, and CDK4. PLS bears additional CCND1 amplifications. MLS, on the other hand, harbors a fusion of TLS/FUS–CHOP, which is responsible for pathogenesis. Angiosarcomas are diverse malignancies and bear aberrations in MYC, VEGF/VEGFR, PTPRB, and PLCG1. Leiomyosarcomas have frequent X-chromosome (Chr) gains, constitutively activated Akt and losses in Chr 10, which bears the PTEN gene. The two latter aberrations lead to mTOR activation via TSC2 and are instrumental in disease pathology. Rhabdomyosarcoma can be subtyped into alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) and embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). The former is associated with PAX3/7–FOXO1 fusions and cause Hippo-pathway dysregulation accompanied by bypass of cellular senescence, and the latter is distinguished by losses in Chr 11, along with gene mutations in the Ras pathway. Other pathways involved include Hedgehog, PI3K, and p53. Ewing’s sarcoma is characterized by EWS–ETS gene fusion, and this potent transcription factor induces genes associated with proliferation, apoptosis inhibition, and metabolic changes to favor biosynthesis and cell division. Synovial sarcoma (SS) is associated with SYT–SSX fusions: SYT–SSX2 for monophasic SS and SYT–SSX1/2 for biphasic SS. Arrows indicate gene transcription.",cmar-10-1089Fig1

Loss of FUS function is involved in the early phenotypic pathomechanism of FTLD/ALS. Loss of FUS function in the nucleus, such as aberrant interaction with SFPQ, causes an imbalance in tau isoforms, which subsequently affects adult neurogenesis, phosphorylated tau accumulation, and neurodegeneration (Ishigaki et al., 2017). However, loss of FUS in the dendritic spine reduces the stability of GluA1 and SynGAP mRNA. This synaptic protein reduction impairs the maturation of spines (Udagawa et al., 2015; Yokoi et al., 2017).

MRI studies demonstrated structural and network changes of caudate nucleus across the sporadic ALS-FTD-spectrum as follows: (1) Gray matter volume loss was the most significant in the caudate head in ALS-FTD patients relative to controls. (2) TBSS analysis showed significantly decreased FA values in widespread white matter, particularly surrounding the caudate nucleus in patients with ALS-CD and ALS-FTD, relative to controls (3) Probabilistic diffusion tractography from the head of the caudate nucleus showed extensive decreased connectivity in not only ALS-FTD and ALS-CD but also in ALS-NC. FTLD-TDP patients showed a significant reduction in the axon terminals of the glutamatergic cortical-striatal projection neurons at the caudate head and putamen, as quantified by VGLUT-1 immunohistochemistry. ALS patients showed decreased loss of VGLUT-1-positive axon terminals predominantly in the putamen. CN-positive efferent neurons from the striatum were markedly involved in the following order: ALS < FTD-MND < FTD. The striatal neuronal loss was more predominant in the caudate head than in the putamen. All FTLD-TDP patients exhibited a significant reduction in axon terminals of striatal efferent neurons immunohistochemically assessed by substance-P and enkephalin in the SNr/GPi and GPe.

However, the tumor dissociation into cell line disrupts tumor microenvironment and alters intratumor heterogeneity. Alternatively, small fragments (~2–3 mm in diameter) of resected tumor are entirely xenotransplanted into immunocompromised mice to generate PDX tumors that can be further used for serial engraftments. Alternatively, grafted tumors are cryopreserved prior to further utilization.

Less than 5% of the reviewed tumor looked like UPS. These areas feature scattered large, bizarre, frankly malignant pleomorphic cells, present in a background of moderately atypical spindled to epithelioid sarcoma cells, with some admixed collagen deposition. (d) Besides the areas of UPS (a–c), other areas were also compatible with sarcoma; these areas were often present along the apparent “surfaces” of the tissue, where it presumably bordered cystic spaces. These areas consisted of hypercellular proliferations of mildly to moderately atypical spindle cells with a “streaming” growth pattern. The results of IHC studies of these areas also showed no definite line of differentiation (undifferentiated). These areas accounted for 5–10% of reviewed tumor area. As these areas were usually located along the apparent surfaces of cystic spaces, which were often bloody spaces, they often had admixed hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition. (e) The majority of the solid tissue within the specimen appeared benign and reactive – as shown in this picture. These areas often consisted of reactive-appearing collagenous fibrosis, with some focal entrapped fat, and with foci of chronic inflammation.

A 51 MLS tumors and two MLS cell lines (402-91 and 1765-92) were sequenced with an MLS specific lockdown panel. Chromosomal translocations could be detected in 49/51 tumors (1 - 49) and both cell lines (C1, C2) and occurred between DDIT3 and FUS in 87.7% and between DDIT3 and EWSR1 in 8.3%. Breakpoints clustered to several distinct regions within DDIT3 and FUS but were not restricted to a single site. For 36 tumors, both breakpoints of the reciprocal translocation could be determined. Arrows depict the sites where the chromosomal breaks occurred. Areas with an increased likelihood of chromosomal breaks are colored in blue. Breakpoints were annotated to homo sapiens (human) genome assembly GRCh38 (hg38). B For 36 tumors, where both breakpoints could be sequenced, loss or gain of DNA during the translocation event could be determined and specifically mapped to either DDIT3 or FUS. A mean loss of 7 bp (SD 64 bp) occurred on chromosome 12 (DDIT3) and of 11 bp (SD 73 bp) on chromosome 16 (FUS). There was considerable intertumor variability. Each symbol of the graph represents one tumor, with the largest gain of 282 bp on chromosome 16 and the biggest deletion of 138 bp on chromosome 12. C Point mutations occurred most commonly in the TERT promoter region (73%) and PIK3CA (33%). Only one tumor showed an additional point mutation in TET2 and one tumor analyzed for intratumor heterogeneity (tumor 2 in Fig. 1 D) displayed two mutations in PTEN. TERT promoter mutations were all detected at the well-known hotspot locations C228T and C250T, with a prevalence of 61% and 12% of all analyzed tumors respectively. PIK3CA mutations occurred at well-known hotspot mutations in exon 9 (c.1624G > A, c.1633G > A, c.1633G > C, c1634A > G) and exon 20 (c.3140A > G) but also at less commonly annotated positions in exon 5 (c.1035 T > A) and exon 8 (c. 1345C > A). D To determine intratumor heterogeneity of MLS, 20 individual samples of tumor 1 were taken at uniform distances and 10 samples were taken from tumor 2. Each sample was analyzed separately with the standard panel. The individual tumor-specific breakpoints identified before (Fig. 1 A) were detectable in all samples. There were no TERT promoter mutations in tumor 1, however PIK3CA mutations were present in 3/20 samples. Two showed a hotspot mutation in exon 9 (chr3:179,218,294; c.1624G > A) and one samples had a hotspot mutation in exon 20 (chr3:179,234,297; c.3140A > G). In tumor 2, TERT promoter mutations were present in all samples, however nine samples contained the C250T and one sample the C228T mutations. PIK3CA mutations were even more diverse. 6/10 samples contained a PIK3CA mutation. Of these samples three showed the well-known hotspot mutation in exon 9 (chr3:179,218,304; c.1634A > G) and the remaining three the hotspot mutation in exon 20 (chr3:179,234,297; c.3140A > G). A deletion (c.388del) and a point mutation in (c.377C > A) were identified in PTEN. The intratumor heterogeneity of PIK3CA, PTEN and the TERT promoter point towards multiple subclones which emerge from a tumor ancestor that initially acquired the characteristic t (12;16) driver translocation. Depicted is the tumor (red), which was reconstructed from the patients’ MRI scans. The black lines depict how the tumor was sectioned for histopathologic assessment. Although the samples were taken at uniform distances throughout the tumor, the exact location of each sample within the tumor cannot be determined due to the retrospective nature of the study",12943_2022_1523_Fig1_HTML

A Quantification of ctDNA in 9 plasma samples of patient 1 collected during 2 years of treatment. ctDNA was determined by NGS (standard panel) and PIK3CA mutations (c.1624G > A and c.3140A > G) were additionally quantified by ddPCR. He initially presented with a localized MLS of the thigh which was completely resected. Soon after, he developed metastatic disease with predominantly osseous lesions. He then received radiotherapy of bone metastasis and several courses of chemotherapy. Repeated imaging during follow-up showed numerous new skeletal lesions and the patient again received radiotherapy to selected metastasis. He succumbed to his disease 1.5 years after removal of the primary tumor. ctDNA increased to 172 copies/ml (sample 6) when metastatic disease was detected and decreased during radio/chemotherapy to 14 copies/ml (sample 7) and 7 copies/ml (sample 8). There was a rapid incline in ctDNA when multiple new metastases were detected (sample 9: 552 copies/ml). Standard imaging, which reflects the total mass of viable and necrotic tumor cells, showed a steady increase (blue area). The irradiated tumor volume is depicted as a surrogate marker for the necrotic tumor mass (green area). t (12;16) ctDNA levels were higher than PIK3CA ctDNA concentrations. This most likely reflect intertumor heterogeneity with only a fraction of metastases carrying PIK3CA mutations (Fig. 1 D and Supplementary Fig. 4). B Additional target mutations from exome sequencing increase sensitivity of ctDNA detection. Tumor 2 was subjected to exome sequencing to identify additional target mutations. Together with breakpoints and mutations from the standard panel, a 7320 bp hybrid exome panel targeting 15 genomic regions was designed. ctDNA in plasma obtained during treatment was determined by the standard and exome panel. He initially received neo-adjuvant radiotherapy to an MLS of his right thigh and subsequently the tumor was completely resected. Two plasma samples were collected prior to commencement of radiotherapy, a third sample before surgery and a fourth sample after tumor resection. ctDNA quantified by the exome panel (red line) was present in similar amounts at the two time points before treatment, declined after radiotherapy and was not detectable after tumor resection. The standard panel (dashed black line) could detect ctDNA only in the first sample, showing reduced sensitivity compared to the exome panel. The blue area represents the tumor volume as calculated from the MRI scans. C Comparison of different assays in detecting MLS tumor-DNA. Dilution series of MLS tumor-DNA from two tumors (patient 2 and 3) in matched normal DNA were analyzed by ddPCR (PIK3CA mutations p.N345K, c.1035 T > A and p.E545G, c.1634A > G), the NGS standard panel and respective exome panels. Depicted are mean values and linear regression of n = 2 tumors for ddPCR, n = 2 for the standard panel and n = 2 for the exome panels. We observed a similar performance for ddPCR and the standard panel, whereas detection of tumor-DNA with exome panels was clearly superior. D Patient 3 presented with two small localized tumors of his legs (red) after numerous prior resections at another hospital. The tumors were completely resected, but he repeatedly developed local recurrences at both locations in the following years. E These recurrences were subsequently resected at four consecutive operations before a small lung metastasis (0.3 cm3) was detected and subsequently removed. Exome panels were obtained from sequencing one of the primary lesions and the lung metastasis. ctDNA was subsequently quantified with both panels in 15 plasma samples obtained during the course of his treatment. During multifocal localized disease, ctDNA values undulated at low concentrations depending on the presence of viable tumor tissue. The exome panel from the primary tumor best reflected the clinical course (enlarged image section). There was one outlier (circle). Despite complete tumor resections, ctDNA values never reached the baseline indicating MRD. In contrast the plasma sample obtained shortly before resection of the lung metastasis showed markedly increased ctDNA with a decline after its resection. The red line represents ctDNA values measured by the exome panel from the primary lesion and the dashed line ctDNA measured by the exome panel obtained from the lung metastasis. The blue area depicts the tumor volume",12943_2022_1523_Fig2_HTML

(C) Schematic picture of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Janus kinases are phosphorylated and activated by cytokine binding to receptors which result in phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins that translocate into the nucleus, where they can regulate transcription of target genes. The SWI/SNF and PRC2 complexes are potentially involved in the pathway through interactions with FUS-DDIT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). Members of the PTP, SOCS, and PIAS families act as inhibitors of the pathway. Non-specific IgG was used as a negative control.

The gradient of a RanGTP-RanGDP across the nuclear membrane is maintained by Ran regulators (RanGAP) in the cytoplasm and regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) in the nucleus. RCC1 converts RanGDP to RanGTP leading to higher concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus. After binding to RanGTP, NES-binding groove of XPO1 changes to an open conformation letting NES containing cargo proteins bind.(2) The ternary complex of RanGTP/XPO1/cargo protein transports through nuclear pore complex (NPC) and undergoes conformational change mediated by RanGAP and its co-stimulatory compound (RanBP1/2) leading to release of RanGTP which is afterward hydrolyzed into RanGDP.(3) After losing RanGTP, XPO1 returns to its original conformation and prompts the release of cargo proteins into the cytoplasm.",10.1177_17588359221081073-fig1

Research mainly focuses on DDLPS and MLPS, whereas insights on the immune microenvironment of WDLPS and PLPS are scarce and lacking in the case of MPLPS. DDLPS is characterized by a higher infiltration of T cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) compared to MLPS and TAMs are outnumbering T cells in DDLPS while this was not observed in MLPS. Both subtypes exhibit low T cell receptor (TCR) clonality and additionally, MLPS tumors display low levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression. Response to pembrolizumab in DDLPS patients was correlated to a higher density of T cells and a higher proportion of PD-L1+ TAMs at baseline. Furthermore, the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in DDLPS is associated with response to pembrolizumab treatment and correlates with elevated infiltration levels of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells as well as CD20+ B cells. In MLPS, tumor cells can promote M2 polarization of TAMs which in turn can enhance the motility and invasiveness of MLPS cells. While several immune cell types are of undefined prognostic value in LPS, accumulating evidence suggests a link to positive prognosis for B cells and TLS in DDLPS and an association with negative prognosis for TAMs, both CD68+ and CD163+, in MLPS.",cancers-14-04578-g002

In the absence of DNA damage, MDM2 facilitates ubiquitination of p53, tagging it for proteosomal degradation. Damage to DNA activates kinases, including ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase, which are responsible for phosphorylating MDM2 and reducing its affinity to bind cytosolic p53. Regulators of the MDM2–p53 interaction include the AKT/mTOR pathway, ARF, and c-MYC. Downstream transcriptional targets of p53 serve to arrest cell-cycle progression and induce cellular apoptosis. Multiple sites of action are targeted by MDM2 and MDM2–p53 inhibitors, which decrease p53 degradation in tumors with wild-type p53. Created with BioRender.com.",fonc-12-1006959-g003

(A) Localization of CENPF at different phases of cell cycle.

(B) SCH66336 (lonafarnib) competitively inhibits the binding of FTase to CAAX peptide of CENPF, thereby repressing its farnesylation.

MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds directly to the N-terminus of p53, bringing p53 to 26S proteasome for degradation, preventing the tumor suppressive function of p53, which regulates numerous cellular functions to safeguard the cells from oncogenesis. A number of MDM2 inhibitors have been synthesized and tested in vitro, in vivo and in early-stage clinical trials (see ongoing clinical trials section below). Many of these inhibitors bind to the MDM2-p53 interface and prevent the binding of MDM2 to p53, therefore stabilizing the protein levels of the wild-type p53 protein.
