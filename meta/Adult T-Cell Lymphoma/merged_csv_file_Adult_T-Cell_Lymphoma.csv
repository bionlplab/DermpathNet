(A) TaxBP181 (hsMad1). During interphase TaxBP181 (light blue) is localized to the nucleus (yellow) and some co-localize with Tax (green) in infected cells. During the transition to prophase (1) in normal cells, TaxBP181 localizes to the kinetochores of chromosomes and allows proper segregation. (2) In normal cells during anaphase and telophase, TaxBP181 localizes to the midbody and finally in newly formed progeny nuclei. (3) When Tax is expressed in ATL cells, TaxBP181 is translocated to the nucleus, allowing for chromosome missegregation, resulting in multinucleated cells (4). (B) RanBP1. During interphase, Tax (green) is found in the nucleus and a portion is co-localized with RanBP1 (purple) on centrosomes. Interaction of Tax with RanBP1 dysregulates the centrosome duplication pathway resulting in cells with two or more centrosomes following mitosis. (C) Tax1BP2. During interphase Tax (green) is expressed in the nucleus and a portion co-localizes with pericentrin (purple) in centrosomes. During S phase centrosomes are duplicated. However, the interaction of Tax with Tax1BP2 (yellow) disrupts the normal controls that prevent centrosome re-duplication resulting in cells with more than two centrosomes. During mitosis, supernumerary centrosomes are separated into two daughter cells resulting in a percentage of cells with two or more centrosomes.",1742-4690-3-50-1
