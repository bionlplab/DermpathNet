Also, some LM can present as part of PROS, the inhibitors against PI3K, i.e., LY294002, BYL719 and Wortmannin, may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of LM. The mutations on PIK3CA can increase AKT-Thr308 phosphorylation, triggering high cellular proliferative and sprouting potential of LM-LECs, which could be inhibited by the specific small molecular inhibitors, such as ARQ092, MK-2206. MK-2206 may be worthy of further treatment of LM. Sirolimus can potently and specifically inhibit the activity mTOR. PIK3CA mutation can repress ANG2 by conducting phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of FOXO1, which is the essential transcription factors for ANG2 expression.

Both VEGF-C and neuropilin2 (Nrp2) are upregulated in recurrent lymphangiomas. These findings imply that targeting VEGF-C/Nrp2 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for recurrent lymphangioma.
