The mRNA from frozen tissue is then heat fragmented to approximately 100–200 bases. This heat fragmentation is incorporated with the RNA heat denature in the 1st strand cDNA synthesis by including the 1st strand cDNA buffer which contains Mg that is required for fragmentation. The short mRNA from FFPET is converted directly to cDNA without fragmentation. The 1st strand cDNA is synthesized with an oligo-dT_P7 RT primer that consists of three parts: 25-oligo-dT, P7 sequence linked to oligo-dT at the 5′ end and two degenerate nucleotides NV at the 3′ end. The single stranded cDNA is then converted to double stranded cDNA and the P5 linker is ligated to the end of the cDNA fragment opposite the P7 linker. The linker-ligated cDNA fragments of approximately 250 bp are selected and a PCR reaction is performed with primers that hybridize to the P5 and P7 linkers. The sequencing library is unidirectional and composed of cDNA, the P7 linker adjacent to the poly-A tail and the P5 linker on the opposite end of the fragment. The library is sequenced from the P5 end to generate 36 bp reads by a synthesis procedure using the Illumina Genome Analyzer. The first 25 bp of each read is used to map the reads to the genome.

The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. A) In absence of Wnt signal the destruction complex, formed by the scaffold Axin, APC and GSK3, phosphorilates (P) β-catenin that is then ubiquitinated and degraded via proteasome. In this state the expression of the gene target is repressed. B) In presence of Wnt ligand, the receptor Fzd and the co-receptor LRP5/6 transduce the signal activating Dvl. The destruction complex is inhibited and β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and it translocates into the nucleus. It promotes the target gene expression by binding TCF/LEF and other co-activators. To date several studies identified small molecules (some of these are indicated in the yellow boxes) that can directly inhibit specific components of the Wnt pathway.

The figure shows a simplified schematic model, which is applicable to all the inducing drugs, although the predominance of the pathogenic mechanisms described may vary.The gingival tissue is subjected to multiple aggressions that induce a state of permanent tissue repair involving the inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and chemotactic factors. The presence of myofibroblasts is a well-established feature of the wound healing process.Genetically predetermined gingival fibroblasts -responders- are more sensitive to the GO-inducing drugs than other fibroblast subpopulations. This fibroblast heterogeneity leads to variations in the production of potentially proliferative, fibroblastic cytokines/GFs, and in their environmental responses to ECM components; myofibroblast cell possesses profibrotic characteristics capable of synthesizing molecule compounds for tissue remodeling, as observed in DIGO. The myofibroblast is active during the reparative process of DIGO, but disappears selectively due to apoptosis and the survival of other fibroblasts groups. Myofibroblast apoptosis is critical for normal healing, as the persistence of cell favors continuous ECM deposition and the development of pathologic fibrotic conditionsDIGO – Drug Induced Gingival OvergrowthSOS-1 – Genetic variability of fibroblasts with phenotypes of different behavior (Integrin function modulation)(*) Genetic risk factor for DIGO.",TODENTJ-11-420_F2

PMC9217905,Fig. 1,"Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway coordinates cell proliferation, differentiation and fate during both embryogenesis and in normal adult tissues. a In the absence of a Wnt signal, cytoplasmic β-catenin that is not involved in cell-cell adhesion interacts with a degradation complex comprising axin, APC, GSK3 and CK1. Here, the sequential phosphorylation of β-catenin by CK1 and GSK3 marks it for ubiquitylation and degradation. This constant degradation prevents β-catenin from entering the nucleus and promoting the transcription of Wnt target genes. b The binding of Wnt to its frizzled receptor and LRP co-receptor leads to the recruitment of dishevelled. Together, this complex recruits the degradation complex to the cell membrane where LRP becomes phosphorylated by GSK3 then CK1. Axin then binds to the phosphorylated LRP, resulting in the disassembly of the degradation complex. Consequently, the stabilisation of β-catenin allows it to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus. Here, it binds to the TCF/LEF promotor region to stimulate the transcription of Wnt target genes including CCND1 (cyclin D1), MYC, PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2), MMP7, VEGF and WISP1. With deregulated, constitutive activation, the resultant protein products may drive tumourigenesis by enhancing proliferation, angiogenesis and invasiveness [10–14].

PMC9217905,Fig. 5,"Key molecular drivers associated with desmoid tumour pathophysiology. a β-Catenin primarily coordinates cell proliferation, differentiation and fate, with its deregulated signalling being intrinsically linked to the development of several human cancers, such as skin, colon and breast cancer [13, 14]. Cyclin D1 and c-Myc signalling is commonly deregulated in tumourigenesis due to their promotional effects on cell proliferation by enhancing the G1 to S-phase transition of the cell cycle [34, 35]. b Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) is an inducible member of the cyclooxygenase family involved in multiple physiological purposes. In colorectal cancer, COX2 has been extensively implicated in promoting angiogenesis, invasion and proliferation through the upregulation of growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor [37, 38]. The multi-functional transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) superfamily and related growth factors play complex and often opposing roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, regeneration and morphogenesis [41]. c Oestrogens are steroid hormones that promote growth, differentiation and reproduction throughout a range of human tissues. Their role in tumourigenesis has been extensively studied in breast cancer, where aberrant signalling drives proliferation, invasion and metastasis [44]. d Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and related proteases play a pivotal role in cancer pathogenesis through their modulation of extracellular matrix, angiogenesis, cell migration and growth [48]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a prominent angiogenic mediator whose expression is commonly upregulated in cancer tissue by various oncogenes, growth factors and hypoxia to sustain growth and invasion [52]. e The tumour suppressor genes RB1, CDKN2A and TP53 inhibit cell proliferation by arresting cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, with the latter protein being upregulated in response to DNA damage [53, 55]. f In its cell membrane function, β-catenin complexes with other proteins, such as α-catenin and N-cadherin, to mediate epithelial cell-cell adhesion and stability [57].

Consequently, the mutated β-catenin is not marked for degradation, allowing it to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus where it promotes the unregulated transcription of specific target genes.

(A) The five-state kinetic model in the lower part (white background) of the scheme applies to homomeric KCNQ1 channels with saturating concentrations of Ca2+ and CaM (high Ca-CaM). To account for the effects of reduced Ca2+, three closed states (*) were added without direct access to the open states IO and AO (low Ca-CaM; blue background). From IC*, channels have to pass through AC* to enable channel opening. (B) Model parameter used to describe WT KCNQ1 channel behavior with low and high intracellular Ca-CaM. k5 and k8 determine the access to *states; the ratio of k5/(k5+k6) mirrors the amount of current reduction induced by decreased levels of calcified CaM.

Once 18 months pass following initial treatment, individual patients either continue to have progressive early-stage Dupuytren’s disease (DD), enter quiescent early-stage DD, or progress to late-stage DD; the probability of each outcome varies between treatments. Patients with late-stage DD progress directly to the untreated late-stage DD state. Quiescent patients have no change in flexion deformity for a certain number of years (see Table I). After that period, they will either be retreated or have progressive early-stage DD (depending on treatment group). Patients with progressive early-stage DD experience progressive changes in flexion deformity (although these are shown as linear in the figure, in practice the change in flexion deformity during each six-month period varies stochastically and may be negative). When the flexion deformity exceeds 30°, patients enter the untreated late-stage DD state. In late-stage DD, patients may undergo a prespecified series of surgical procedures. In the base case analysis, this comprised up to three percutaneous needle fasciotomies (PNF), no more than one limited fasciectomy and no more than one dermofasciectomy.
