PMC5643940,Figure 3,"The PET/CT images performed for response evaluation at the 24th month after initial diagnosis showed two new lesions in the right breast. The interval between the last two PET/CT imaging was about one year, and these breast lesions were new findings. (A, B, C): The initial FDG PET/CT images with no lesion both anatomically and metabolically in the breast tissue. (D, E, F): The second year FDG PET/CT examination revealed an unexpected, lobulated hypermetabolic solid mass measuring 19x30 mm with a SUVmax of 5.2 in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast. There was also a smaller non-metabolic lesion next to this lesion. The patient underwent incisional biopsy, the histopathologic examination revealed ACC in the lateral lesion while the other one was composed of necrotic material. The histology and immunophenotyping of the breast ACC is similar to that of the salivary gland. Therefore, it is difficult to differentiate metastatic disease from a primary breast ACC by pathologic examination. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical behavior of the tumor. In our case, based on the clinical findings (sudden onset in one year), it was diagnosed as metastasis from the primary tumor. Hypermetabolic right parasternal, anterior diaphragmatic/paracardiac lymph nodes were also detected in the same examination. (G, H, I): In the following FDG PET/CT, her metastatic breast lesion progressed anatomically (24x35 mm) while remaining metabolically stable (SUVmax: 5.6). Anterior mediastinal, paracardiac, parasternal and right anterior mediastinal lymph nodes were also detected as new findings while the existing lung metastasis were progressing. (D, G): The patient also had multiple hypodense stable lesions in the liver that did not show any FDG uptake, compatible with hemangiomas. The patient’s chemoradiotherapy is still on-going in the third year of diagnosis. In the consecutive follow-up PET/CT images performed at 4 month intervals, her metastatic lung lesions, lymph nodes and breast lesion all have been progressing both in dimension and metabolically.
Breast metastasis from extra-mammary neoplasms is very rare, with a reported incidence of 0.5-3% (6). Also, the incidence of unexpected breast focal uptake in 18F-DG-PET/CT is reported as 0.36-1.12% (7,8,9). The rate of malignancy in incidental FDG-avid breast foci was reported in a range of 37.5-83% (10,11,12).

(C) Schematic representation of MYB variants expressed in leukemia and solid tumors. Both AMV v-Myb and E26 proteins are truncated at both the N- and C-termini of c-MYB.

It also has 11 point mutations that cause amino acid changes (gray dots). The E26 protein is a Gag-MYB-Ets fusion protein with 272 amino acids of the retroviral Gag protein fused to MYB, which in turn is fused to 491 amino acids from Ets-1transcription factor at the C-terminus. Aberrant expression of MYB-9A in adult T-cell leukemia correlates with poor outcomes. C-terminal truncated protein has also been identified inTK-6, a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line. The fusion of MYB and NFIB genes (translocation 6; 9) generates a MYB-NFIB fusion protein in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) that resembles truncated MYB protein.

PMC5907674,Figure 2,"Model for the regulation of MYB transcriptional elongation. MYB transcriptional elongation is regulated by sequences within intron 1, which encode a RNA stem loop and a poly U tract of 19 uridines that stall RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). RNA Pol II overcomes transcription blockade through the attenuation region to express full-length MYB transcripts in normal cells. In colon cancer, the sequences encoding the stem loop or poly U tract are mutated, which disrupts transcriptional attenuation. In ER+ breast cancer, estrogen receptor α (ERα) and the PTEFB complex are recruited to the transcriptional attenuation region upon estrogen stimulation. Transcriptional block is relieved by the phosphorylation of the Ser-2 residue of RNA Pol II by the CDK9 subunit of PTEFB. In human leukemia cells, MYB transcriptional elongation is facilitated by the binding of the NFκB p50-p65 heterodimer to the stem loop, which mediates the recruitment of PTEFB and subsequent Ser-2 phosphorylation of RNA Pol II by CDK9.",jcav09p1259g002

PMC7349363,Figure 1,"Notch signalling and strategies for pharmacological targeting of this pathway. Right Inset: Notch receptors consist of N-terminal EGF-like repeats, followed by three Lin12/Notch repeats (LNR) and the heterodimerisation (HD) domain, which together form the negative regulatory region (NRR). Next, there is a single transmembrane (TM) repeat, followed by an intracellular RBP-J-associated molecule (RAM), ankyrin repeats (ANK), a transcriptional TAD domain and a degradation PEST domain. Notch-activating mutations (labelled with the star) are commonly found in the HD and PEST domain. Main diagram: Immature Notch receptor is processed in the trans-Golgi network where a furin-like protease cleaves it at Site S1 within the HD domain, located between the LNR and the TM, creating the mature heterodimeric Notch receptor, sustained by NRR. Notch-specific ligands located on a neighbouring cell (e.g., Jagged-1/2 or Delta-like ligand (DLL-) 1/3/4) interact with the N-terminal of the mature Notch receptor, causing activation (i.e., release of its autoinhibited conformation). ADAM 10/17 matrix metalloproteinases cleave Notch at Site S2 located in TM (extracellular side). The remaining TM domain is cleaved by a gamma secretase at Site S3 (intracellular side). Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released and translocates to the nucleus where it forms a complex with DNA-binding transcription factors RBP-J (CSL), mastermind-like (MAML) protein and other coactivator proteins and enzymes, and stimulates transcription of Notch target genes including the hairy/enhance of split 1 (HES) and Hes-related (HEY) families of transcription repressors, such as HES1 and HEY1. There are numerous strategies to pharmacologically target Notch signalling including Notch receptor monoclonal antibodies, ligand-targeted antibodies (e.g., DLL-4 antibodies), gamma secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and Notch transcription complex small-molecule inhibitors.",cells-09-01503-g001

Adenoid cystic carcinoma is known for its often indolent growth, and patients can remain asymptomatic for years, even with distant metastases, which mainly occur in the lungs and bones.1,2 A 55-year-old man with metastatic ACC arising from the left bronchus previously received tumor resections of the primary tumor in 2011 and of the liver (in 2013) and subcutaneous metastases (in 2014). From 2015, very slow-growing metastases arose in the liver, spleen, lungs, and bones. Because of relatively stable disease and no disease complaints, the patient did not receive systemic therapy,3 but was under active surveillance with contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen every 3 months. During one of these scans in 2017, cardiac lesions were observed and suspected to be metastases. Cardiac metastases in ACC patients are extremely rare; only one other case is described in literature.4

Therefore, salivary gland tumors have been investigated for PSMA-ligand uptake.7–9 The patient presented above participated in a study (NCT03319641),7 shortly after the suspicion of cardiac metastases on CT. A (axial fusion and PET images) visualizes tracer uptake of the lung metastases corresponding to Figure 1A and the pericardial lesion corresponding to Figure 2B.

PMC7488362,Figure 2,"Diagram depicting the mechanism of CR involving multiple signaling pathways. J2 feeders are able to produce ECM components such as collagen, laminin, glycoproteins and interstitial procollagens to facilitate primary cell attachment61. J2 feeders also secrete diffusible factors such as HGF and HBEGF which may result in activation of receptors of MET, EGFR, HER2 and VEGFR97. As a result, the STAT, MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways may be further stimulated62,63. The activated HGF–MET signals also lead to increased phosphorylation of GAB2 and STAT697, but the subsequent function is not clear. The inhibition of P53 pathway is found critical for CR cells to invade apoptosis64. Moreover, Y27632 as a ROCK inhibitor is associated with the suppression of TGF-β/SMAD pathway as well as proteins of P27, PTEN, MLC and MYPT65. CR condition is also capable of triggering the non-classical pathway of β-catenin via increasing PP2Ac activity66. In addition, most CR cells have increased expression of stem cell markers such as CD44 and P6367, enhanced hTERT activity, and inactivated pRB/P1668. The consequence of CR on primary cells is the promotion of proliferation, acceleration of cell cycle progression, suppression of apoptosis and differentiation and maintenance of stem cell properties.",gr2

Although early histological examination help distinguish between normal and tumor tissues, mixed CR culture of both normal and tumor cells is often seen in early passages. In some cases, normal primary cell outgrows tumor cells. To selectively maintain primary tumor cell culture, it is suggested to use human fibroblast instead of mouse fibroblast as feeder cells, which preferentially supports tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, short-term serum-free medium induces differentiation of CR normal cells, which is irreversible by re-using complete medium, but CR tumor cells can be recovered. 3D culture or xenografts also can mediate irreversible differentiation of normal cells.

PMC8746899,FIGURE 1,"A 59-year-old man with a history of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) from the nasopharynx has previously been treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Eight years after the primary treatment, pulmonary metastases were diagnosed on a chest radiograph, which was performed because of a persisting cough. In a subgroup of patients with ACC disease, distant metastases can be detected several years after initial diagnosis, often related due to the indolent tumor growth of ACC and often asymptomatic metastases.1,2 In case of recurrent or metastatic ACC disease, systemic therapy should mainly be considered for patients with symptomatic disease or rapid progression.3,4 Although there is still no standard systemic treatment for ACC, previous single-arm phase 2 studies showed the efficacy of combinations of cytotoxic drugs5 or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.6,7 Yet, response rates of these drugs are moderate, and participation in clinical trials is advised.4 Previously, because of symptomatic disease, the patient received cabozantinib treatment in a clinical trial. Unfortunately, the clinical trial closed prematurely due to severe toxicity in other included patients, and the cabozantinib treatment was discontinued after 1 month.8 After 1 year, his disease-related symptoms increased, and recently, the patient developed malignant pleural effusion (diagnosed on imaging, not validated with pleural puncture), without dyspnea. Therefore, other systemic treatment options were considered. Recently, this patient received both 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET and 18F-FDG PET imaging as part of the screening procedure for a 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy study. Because ACC tumors are often avid on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging9 and PSMA radioligand therapy has shown good results in prostate cancer,10,11 we initiated a clinical trial (NCT04291300) applying 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy for salivary gland cancer patients, including ACC patients. The time interval between the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET and 18F-FDG PET scan was <1 week. In addition to a comparable uptake on both PET scans of the pulmonal and pleural metastases, the malignant pleural effusion was also clearly visible. PSMA PET imaging is most often performed in prostate cancer patients, yet malignant pleural effusion in prostate cancer is rare and only 1 case report on 68Ga-PSMA–avid malignant pleural effusion in prostate cancer has been reported.12 PSMA PET imaging is lately being investigated for several cancers other than prostate cancer.13

PMC9394511,Figure 9,"Schematic model illustrating the PI3K/AKT pathway associated with CCRL25/CCR9-induced malignant biological behavior in SACC.CCL25 acts on CCR9, a G protein-coupled receptor located on the SACC cell membrane, resulting in activation of the G protein and release of the Gβγ subunit, thereby activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Vercirnon is a CCR9 inhibitor, and LY294002 is a blocker of the PI3K/AKT pathway. PI3K/AKT pathway activation can upregulate the mitochondrial-mediated anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, thus inhibiting caspase 3-dependent tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore, CCL25 activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway leads to an increase in the expression of the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1 and the protooncogene c-Myc, thus promoting the proliferation of tumor cells. Furthermore, the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway activates its downstream transcription factor SLUG, leading to regulation of the expression of EMT-related factors (E-cadherin and vimentin) and ECM degradation-related factors (MMPs), which enhances the migration and invasion abilities of SACC cells.",peerj-10-13844-g009

(b) Microscopy images are processed by a convolutional neural network to produce images that represent the probability that an organoid is present at each pixel.

PMC10000502,Figure 1,"Endoscopic view of the larynx showing the lesion. The adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) arises from the minor salivary glands. It accounts for 1–5% of all head and neck malignancies. Since the minor salivary glands are present in small amounts throughout the larynx, the laryngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma is sporadic, representing less than 1% of all laryngeal malignancies [1]. Regarding the onset of laryngeal ACC (LACC), the prevalent age ranges from 50 to 60 years. However, younger generations can be affected, and both sexes are equally affected, with a slight male predominance and a male-to-female ratio of 1,5:1. There is no evidence connecting LACC etiology with smoking. An early perineural and hematological spread make this kind of carcinoma liable for local recurrence and distant metastasis, especially to the lung. Therefore, is important to increase the frequency of controls during follow-up [2]. Laryngeal ACC can originate from any part of the larynx. The most common origin is the subglottic area (64%), followed by the supraglottic area (25%), the glottic area (5%), and the trans-glottic area (6%) [3,4]. The clinical presentation is usually variable and related to the lesion location [5,6,7]. In November 2021, a 70-year-old no-smoker female patient presented to our hospital’s emergency department with stridor, severe dyspnea at rest, and hoarseness of voice. The O2 saturation level was 87% on air without cyanosis. An endoscopic laryngeal examination revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis in adduction. Firstly, the patient underwent an urgent tracheostomy under general anesthesia. The procedure also included a laryngeal examination (micro-laryngeal surgery) under general anesthesia with tumor mapping, which revealed a bilateral mucosal thickening of the anterior thirds and anterior commissures of both vocal folds and a right vocal fold submucosal thickening (Figure 1). Multiple biopsies from different laryngeal areas were taken for histopathological examination. The pathological tissue revealed the presence of an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the solid type associated with the immunophenotype CK AE1 AE3 +, CD117+, CK7+/−, p63 +/−, p40+/−, Vimentin +/−, SMA+/−, S100+/−. Then, the patient underwent a CT scan of the neck chest and brain with a contrast medium and an abdominal ultrasound examination. The first chest, brain, and abdominal radiological evaluations did not show metastatic lesions. The neck CT scan revealed the presence of small submucosal bilateral glottic masses, associated with increased cervical lymph nodes volume, without subglottic and extra-laryngeal extensions (Figure 2).",diagnostics-13-00905-g001

Partial laryngectomy (OPHL II B) with bilateral selective neck dissection (cervical nodal Robbins levels II–IV) and postoperative radiotherapy were planned to manage this case. Unfortunately, this planned surgical intervention was impossible because of the patient’s poor general conditions. Moreover, one of the follow-up CT scans of the chest (three months after the initial one) revealed the presence of bilateral diffuse multiple micronodules, which were considered early distant metastasis from the laryngeal adenoid cystic cancer (Figure 3).",diagnostics-13-00905-g002

Due to the worsening conditions, the patient was mechanically ventilated because of acute respiratory failure. Despite the therapy and mechanical ventilation, the pulmonary functions deteriorated progressively, resulting in the patient’s death. The patient was not diabetic, hypertensive, or cardiopathic and was not a smoker. By anamnestic clinical history, we discovered that two years before this event (October 2019), the subject presented mild hoarseness of voice. At the time, an endoscopic laryngeal examination revealed bilateral mobile vocal folds without apparent abnormalities. For further confirmation, the subject underwent a laryngeal exam under general anesthesia, which showed the absence of any macroscopic lesion, and the histopathological results of the biopsies were negative. The physicians scheduled a follow-up after three months, but unfortunately, the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fear of viral infection prevented her to attend the recommended follow-up visits. The patient was COVID-19-negative throughout the whole illness (Table 1). We performed a literature analysis by searching the PubMed database for ‘laryngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma’. We did not limit the search to article types because of the rarity of the disease and the little number of papers about it. We choose only papers published in English within the past five years. The articles in the database whose full text could not be found were also excluded. The title and abstracts of the identified manuscripts were initially screened and selected by all authors independently (IF, AC, PGM, HE, RA, MF, MR, DM, AG, MdV, CB, and AM) based on their relevance to the review topic. The following set of shared chosen inclusion criteria was applied individually to the selected articles in their full-text version: primary laryngeal affection of adenoid cystic carcinoma and therapy consensus of LACC. The literature search yielded 48 papers. Subsequently, 28 studies were excluded because they did not meet the objective of our review, and 20 studies were included and discussed (Figure 5 and Table 2).",diagnostics-13-00905-g004

A high percentage of distant metastasis has been reported both at first diagnosis and during follow-up. The main distant metastasis site for LACC is the lung, but metastasis can develop in many sites. Iype et al. even described a case of an isolated scapular metastasis [8]. Although the first evaluation of neoplastic disease usually involves TNM staging according to AJCC, which is considered to have a significant prognostic value, Taha M. et al. observed that this is not true for LACC [9]. The histologic grade seems to be a more significant prognostic factor for survival in the presence of LACC, although this finding was established in a small sample of patients [10,11,12,13]. Radiation therapy is not considered a primary curative treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma, whatever its location, but it has been widely used as an adjuvant treatment. Benefits in terms of local control and survival with adjuvant radiotherapy have been reported in many papers [13].",diagnostics-13-00905-g005

Epithelial cells exhibit apical–basal polarity and express specific molecules associated with the maintenance of cell polarity and the epithelial state, which are listed in the blue triangular box. As epithelial cells undergo a progressive loss of their distinctive characteristics, they acquire mesenchymal features while retaining certain epithelial traits. In certain situations, they may acquire a complete set of mesenchymal features. Mesenchymal cells display front-to-back polarity, with a highly reorganized cytoskeleton, and they express a distinct set of molecules that promote and preserve the mesenchymal state (listed in the red triangular box). As a result, cells undergoing EMT exhibit increased migration, invasion, and stem-like properties, which can result in treatment resistance, metastasis formation, and recurrences in patients, ultimately affecting their clinical outcomes. Metastatic colonization requires a reversal of EMT, referred to as mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), which facilitates the expansion of tumor cells, an essential prerequisite for metastatic growth.

PMC10299206,Figure 2,"Overview of TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β signaling is transduced through 2 pathways: canonical (SMAD dependent) and noncanonical (SMAD independent). Signal transduction initiates by binding TGF-β to TβRII, which recruits and transphosphorylates TβRI. Either canonical or noncanonical signaling pathways can subsequently be activated by the TβRI–TβRII complex. After phosphorylation, TβRI becomes activated, then activates the canonical pathway through phosphorylation of R-SMADs (SMAD2 and SMAD3). R-SMADs form heteromeric complexes with Co-SMAD (SMAD4) and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to site-specific recognition sequences (SBEs) and regulate the expression of TGF-β-signaling-pathway target genes. R-SMADs modulate the biogenesis of microRNA (miRNA) by promoting the processing of primary miRNA into precursor miRNA in the nucleus. mG, 5′ capping of messenger RNA (mRNA); AAAAA, 3′ polyadenylation of mRNA. In noncanonical pathways, TGF-β signaling activates SMAD-independent pathways such as the renin–angiotensin system (RAS)/ERK, PI3K/AKT, JNK and p38, NF-κB, and Rho.
