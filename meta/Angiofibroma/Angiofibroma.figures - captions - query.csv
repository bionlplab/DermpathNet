PMC9106361,Figure 2,"MHPA strategy.(A) Schematic representation of the major MHPA steps. MHPA consists of PCR amplification of short DNA segments using primers that include unique molecular identifier (UMI) barcodes, followed by library preparation and sequencing. In the first reaction (step 1), a multiplex linear amplification of each genomic region occurs using reverse primers only with inclusion of a random 14-nt UMI. Following purification, another linear amplification (step 2) of each genomic region occurs using forward primers only. Following purification, amplification of the UMI-barcoded molecules occurs using universal primers (UP) (steps 3 and 4). Step 3 is performed for optimization of MHPA assays, in which amplicons are labeled using a fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), followed by capillary electrophoresis to assess abundance of each amplicon. Step 4 is used to generate the MHPA libraries, which are purified and subjected to MPS. (B) Comparison of conventional and UMI-based MPS variant calling strategies. Barcoding of single DNA molecules with UMIs enables compression of the MHPA data to consensus reads that permits sequencing error suppression.
