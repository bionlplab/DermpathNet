The dermal component, if present, is in the papillary dermis and not in the deep dermis. (B) “Shouldering.” The green arrow points to the dermal component and the black to the junctional component. The junctional component extends to the periphery beyond the dermal component. (C) “Bridging.” The nests of melanocytes in the tips of rete ridges bridge across and are connected. Lamellar fibroplasia is seen underlying the nests and is wrapping around them. (D) Black arrows are pointing towards nests of melanocytes which are bridging across multiple adjacent retia and can be confused with confluent growth. The key here is that the inter-rete space above the papillary dermal tips (indicated by blue arrows) is uninvolved. (E) Lamellar fibroplasia. Bands of pink collagen wrap around the rete and nests of melanocytes that bridge between them. Lymphocytes can be seen scattered in the dermis. (F) Melanocytes are displaying cytological atypia. The nuclei of melanocytes are two to three times larger than the nuclei of spinous layer keratinocytes. The melanocytes have abundant grayish cytoplasm with fine dusty melanin pigment, giving it an appearance of “dirty dishwater.”",cureus-0014-00000026127-i08
