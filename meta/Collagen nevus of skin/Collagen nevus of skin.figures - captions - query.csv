(D) 46-year-old man with truncal collagenomas.",fendo-13-1029041-g002,Match,NotMatch
PMC9618614,Figure 3,"Lipomas in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Lipomas are benign tumors made of mature adipocytes that can arise from anywhere that fat is located. (A) 62-year-old man with a subcutaneous lipoma located over the spine in the mid back. Also seen is an adjacent surgical scar related to the prior resection of a large lipoma and scattered collagenomas. (B) 49-year-old woman with multifocal intramuscular lipomas, including a large posterior thigh lipoma as seen on axial T1-weighted pre- (left panel) and post-contrast (right) magnetic resonance imaging. (C) 16-year-old boy with a mobile soft tissue mass arising over the lower anterior chest. Ultrasound showed a 3.7 cm lesion consistent with lipoma. (D) 25-year-old man with a 3.6 cm lipoma (arrows) in the right scalene muscle, adjacent to the right thyroid lobe, as seen on contrast-enhanced computed tomography.",fendo-13-1029041-g003,Match,NotMatch
PMC9618614,Figure 4,"Leiomyoma (LMA). A 41-year-old man with MEN1 presented with an enlarging, painless perineal swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging (Left panel: contrast–enhanced sagittal T1-weighted fat suppressed image; right panel: axial T2-weighted fat suppressed image) identified a 5.8 x 2.6 x 3.8 cm mass in the perineum abutting the crus of the penis and the bulbous urethra. The mass was completely excised and histologic evaluation confirmed a leiomyoma. Somatic testing of the leiomyoma revealed the known germline pathogenic MEN1 variant and evidence for biallelic loss (loss of heterozygosity) at chromosome 11q (next-generation sequencing performed by Foundation Medicine; Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA).",fendo-13-1029041-g004,NotMatch,NotMatch
