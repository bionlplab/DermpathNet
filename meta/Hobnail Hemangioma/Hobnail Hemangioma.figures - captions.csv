PMC5315040,Figure 1,"Clinical appearance. Pigmented papule, 5 mm diameter, nasal dorsum, brown to black, well delimited. The surrounding skin is of normal appearance. (b) Dermoscopic analysis: arborizing vessels (arrows), multiple brown points (circle) and a large blue-gray oval nest structure (triangle). There is little brown pigment dispersed through the lesion (star). [Copyright: ©2017 Enei et al.]",dp0701a08g001
PMC5315040,Figure 2,"(a) Clinical appearance after one year of evolution. The papule shows no significant changes, including size and color (b) Dermoscopic analysis: the centre of the lesion displays a dense blue-brown pigment with reticular distribution (stars). At the periphery are the extreme distal vessels from Figure 1 (black arrows) and artifacts (black triangles). Two round, yellowish brown structures are in the middle of the pigmented area (segmented arrows). [Copyright: ©2017 Enei et al.]",dp0701a08g002

Irregularly dilated blood vessels mainly in the superficial dermis, having a prominent endothelium composed of relatively small cells (a), with little cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei, projected towards the lumen (hobnail aspect)(b).
