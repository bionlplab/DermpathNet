A, Lumbosacral lipoma with cutaneous dimple. B–D, Sagittal T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) illustrating different anatomical subtypes of lumbosacral lipomas as described by Chapman. Lipoma tissue is closely adherent to splayed neural tissue forming a lipoma–neuronal placode; the lipoma extends through a defect in the posterior dura and vertebral column, before becoming continuous with the subcutaneous fat. Lumbosacral lipomas (LSLs) are classified based on their radiological appearance and relationship to the conus. C, Dorsal LSL: the interface between the lipoma and spinal cord is above the level of the conus. B, Transitional LSL: the interface includes the conus and the lipoma extends into elements of the cauda equina. D, Caudal LSL: the lipoma extends from the tip of the conus to the end of the thecal sac. Caudal LSL may be referred to alternatively as terminal or filar LSL. Pang et al. have recently describe a chaotic form that is most allied to the transitional type, but where the lipoma extends ventrally to the placode and nerve roots.8 [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com]",HIS-72-1136-g001

The border between the true cord and C-LS was determined with IONM, by tracing the evoked compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of the external anal sphincter with stimulation of 1 mA (h), beginning from the functional cord (h-(1)(2)(3)) and proceeding to the to the nonfunctional CL-S (h-(4)(5) (6)).

The caudal and right half of the cyst wall is lipomatous tissue, which became more evident on the 2nd MRI. A sacral perineural cyst is also noted. (h-j) Schematic drawing (h) and microscopic view of the operative findings (i) and IONM (j). A lineal skin incision was made on the mid-lumbosacral region (h-1). Laminoplastic laminotomy of L5-S3 revealed that the caudal spinal cord and C-LS, including the cyst, extended to the dural cul-de-sac without an intervening terminal filum (h-2, i-1). The cyst wall and the lipomatous tissue were observed at the right and caudal side of the C-LS, respectively. IONM, by tracing the evoked CMAPs of the external anal sphincter with stimulation of 0.5 mA, failed to determine the border between the true cord and C-LS, while the amplitude of CMAPs tended to decrease toward the caudal side (j(1)-(6)), probably due to the current spread through the small nerve roots, which were tightly adhered to the ventral surface of the cord and C-LS (i-2). The lipoma with C-LS was severed at the caudal part and elevated (h-3). A small amount of water-like clear fluid flowed out from the cyst and the cyst was collapsed. After confirming nonfunctional C-LS and lipoma with IONM (j(7)(8)), the caudal part of the C-LS along with lipoma was resected as a column (h-4). The lipoma was minimally debulked to enlarge the cyst orifice and make a decent stoma for cystostomy (h-5, i-4).

In particular in the femoral artery, there is a clear co-detection of zyxin and CD31 (green fluorescence) as indicated by the yellow fluorescence. Since CD31 is present in the EC membrane, while zyxin localizes to the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus, the remainder of the EC reveal positive CD31 immunoreactivity right next to that of zyxin.

PMC9221378,Figure 2,"Representative image processing flowchart. An example of a difficult to mask image—lipoma (original OCT image scan region 6 × 3.5 mm). The tissue has many voids in it, and there are strong back reflection lines visible. A naive threshold mask shows why this is an issue. Saturation lines can be mistaken for tissue, and the voids in the tissue structure could be ignored. Hence, the voids were detected and filled, and reflection lines removed. The scanning window, schematically represented by the red square, is moved around within the masked region. The stride is set to 1 in the movement directions (which are indicated by the red arrows). The window looks at each pixel and its surrounding pixels; for a 15 × 15 pixel window, the window contains 225 values. These are then used to calculate μ, σ, intensity range, and CV parameters, and these are then added to an array for later processing. In total, 12 parameters from scanning window data were calculated for each image, then averaged for each sample. The resulting parameter set is used for leave-one-out cross-validation, which generates a table of true and predicted classes. From this, sensitivities and specificities are calculated for each class.",cancers-14-02820-g002

Tumor cell morphology is highly variable, ranging from spindle cells—with a small amount of cytoplasm and elongated nucleus with small nucleoli, to polygonal cells—with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and a large, oval nucleus containing 2–4 moderately- to large-sized nucleoli.

The anatomical subsite pinpoints to a possible persistence of the thyroglossal duct (TGD). This represents an embryological remnant during the migration of the endodermal thyroid diverticulum, and it may extend from the foramen cecum of the base of the tongue to the suprasternal notch [1,2,3]. TGD can variably persist in up to 7% of the adult human population, and its incomplete obliteration (usually by the tenth week of gestation) leads to the creation of the pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland as well as many other neck disorders, including lingual thyroiditis and TGD cyst [4]. The latter in particular is the most frequent congenital central neck mass and it usually presents around 30–40 years of age as an infected cyst (more rarely as a fistula or a sinus), causing neck discomfort and dysphagia [5,6]. Their treatment usually consists of open surgical excision along with the central portion of the hyoid bone’s body and a core of tongue musculature, as described in 1920 by Walter E. Sistrunk from the Mayo Clinic [7]. The differential diagnosis of TGD cysts and midline masses is vast and it includes, among others, dermoid and epidermoid cysts, cystic nodal metastases of papillary thyroid carcinoma, lymphangiomas, lymphomas, ectopic thyroid adenomas, or lipomas [4,8].",diagnostics-13-00932-g001

She complained of mild neck discomfort without frank dysphagia or dyspnea. Upon physical examination, the subcutaneous swelling was soft and nontender, it was partially mobile on swallowing, and there were no signs of infection or inflammation. Her medical history included seasonal allergic rhinitis, nodular osteoarthritis of the hands, primary Sjogren’s syndrome, and a recent diagnosis of euthyroid Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. There were no known allergies nor she was taking any medication. A full ear, nose, and throat evaluation was uneventful, and the cranial nerves function assessment was normal. In particular, transnasal fiberoptic flexible examination revealed regular oropharyngeal and laryngeal structures with no pooling secretions, and normal swallowing phases for both solids and liquids. In the suspicion of a TGD cyst, an initial ultrasound (US) examination was requested and it revealed a non-cystic hypoechoic mass with scattered hyperechoic spots and a normal-looking thyroid gland; no lymphadenopathies were present.

PMC10001181,Figure 5,"Intraoperative picture after the completion of the resection. The PubMed database was used in order to perform the review of the literature from the beginning to November 2022. The CARE (CAse REports) guidelines and its accompanying check-list served as a reference in the preparation of the present report [9]. The following search strings were used: “thyroglossal duct AND lipoma” (eight results); “thyroglossal AND lipoma” (18 results); “neck midline AND lipoma” (15 results). We retrieved a total of 41 articles. After the removal of duplicates and non-pertinent articles, only one paper was included [10]. Tsai and colleagues reported a single case of TGD lipoma, thus making our case the second one to be published in the available literature to the best of our knowledge. The authors described a 3.5 × 3.0 × 3.0 cm3 oval-shaped mass located just between the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage; despite a radiological appearance suspicious for lipoma (isoechoic mass at the US, density in Hounsfield units on the computed tomography scan compatible with fat), the authors performed a full Sistrunk operation and they declare no recurrences at 18 months of follow-up. Histopathological examination revealed a small rim of thyroid tissue adjacent to the mature adipocytes, while data on postoperative swallowing functions were not reported [10]. Instead, Sharudin and coworkers illustrated the case of a 41-year-old man who presented with a submucosal lipoma of the epiglottic valleculae [11]. Despite being potentially akin to our case, we decided not to consider it associated with the TGD tract because of its more posterosuperior localization and its probable origin from the fat occupying the pre-epiglottic space. Furthermore, that lesion presented as an oropharyngeal exophytic mass behind the foramen cecum, and it was amenable to transoral endoscopic resection by electrocautery [11]. Finally, Costa et al. published a case of a lipoma of the pre-epiglottic space causing chronic dysphagia in 2017: in this paper, however, the lesion was completely endolaryngeal (pre-epiglottic and left paraglottic space), no neck masses were apparent, and again transoral laser-assisted resection was sufficient to cure the patient [12].",diagnostics-13-00932-g005
PMC10001181,Figure 6,"Another T2-weighted axial view of the mass on MRI. Ultrasonography is considered to yield a high diagnostic accuracy for subcutaneous lipomas (sensitivity of 88.1%; specificity of 99.3%) [13], but in our case, it was inaccurate in defining the boundaries of the lesion and therefore the surgical planning. Modern CT and MRI techniques offer instead a superb definition of the anatomical relationships as well as a very strong correlation with final histopathology, especially in children [14]. Furthermore, and for midline neck masses only, the role of fine-needle aspiration cytology/biopsy (FNAC/FNAB) remains debatable even for the common TGD cysts: for instance, a retrospective evaluation at the Johns Hopkins Department of Pathology found a diagnostic sensitivity of only 62%, with a calculated positive predictive value of 69% [15,16]. Additionally, imaging remains fundamental to exclude a rarely coexisting carcinoma (usually papillary-type), that usually occurs in patients 40 years of age or older. In detail, classically described features of a suspected malignancy include enhancing solid nodular masses (more frequently observed) and/or calcifications (more specific) within the TGD cyst [6]. Sistrunk’s operation remains the mainstay of management for TGD cysts because it has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence down to 3–10% of adult cases, [17,18,19] and to around 20% in children [20]. There is also a non-negligible rate of postoperative complications and, in a recent large pediatric American series, postoperative rates of cervical seroma, local infection, and need for surgical revision were reported to be 9.5%, 7%, and 7.6%, respectively [21]. For other conditions associated with the TGD remnants instead, the evidence regarding the best surgical approach is weaker. For example, midline dermoid cysts usually require simple excision without sacrificing the hyoid bone and a preoperative differential diagnosis is now feasible by exploiting the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) technique with MRI, or even with ultrasound alone [22,23]. Interestingly, the two lesions may in very rare cases occur at the same time; therefore, some surgeons prefer to perform Sistrunk’s operation for every central (pediatric) neck mass [24,25]. The absence of thyroid tissue in our case might be viewed as a complete lipomatous degeneration of a TGD remnant, as speculated by Tsai and colleagues [10]. However, we currently have no preoperative imaging methods to determine whether thyroid cells are present in these kinds of neck masses unless they are metabolically active and therefore visible on scintigraphy [26]. In the present case, scintigraphy was not performed nor it was available in the study by Tsai et al. [10]. Indeed, the use of a “blind scintigraphy” may constitute an interesting approach in the work-up of midline masses, but the available experience in this regard is limited. It must also be remembered that even in classical TGD cysts, thyroid tissue in the form of follicles or scattered cells are found only in around 50% of cases [27].",diagnostics-13-00932-g006
