PMC4808714,Fig 2,"A, The epidermis showed focally mild hyperplastic areas with atypical keratinocytes in the basal cell layer compatible with differentiated PeIN. B, In several specimens, full-thickness atypia corresponding to carcinoma in situ and foci of invasive squamous cell carcinoma were found. (Hematoxylin-eosin stain.)",gr2
PMC4808714,Fig 3,"A, In the mid and reticular dermis, there were striking areas of pink condensed finely fibrillary and wavy elastic material. (Hematoxylin-eosin stain.) B, Histochemical staining for elastic stain showed a massive increase in elastic fibers in the mid and reticular dermis contrasted strikingly to their near absence in the superficial subepithelial tissues. Elastic stains also showed increased presence of elastic fibers around blood vessels in the reticular portion of the dermis.",gr3
