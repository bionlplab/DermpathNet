Hierarchical clustering of 6 Golden Retriever (GR) hemangiosarcoma samples versus 3 non-Golden Retriever (nGR) hemangiosarcoma samples (GEO series record GSE15086). Increasing green intensity indicates increased gene expression, increasing red intensity indicates decreased gene expression, and black indicates no change. Bars represent groups that cluster together. B. Gene differences between Golden Retrievers (GR) and non-Golden Retrievers (nGR) were plotted according to their cytogenetic location along the 38 autosomes and the X chromosome. Tick marks represent individual genes that show differential regulation, with the color intensity (green to black to red) representing expression changes as described in part A. Genes plotted received a p-value<0.05 and were derived from ANOVA analysis of the global list of filtered genes. C. Quantitative expression analysis of 3 genes found in panel A, TSP-3, DLA88 (MHC), and SMARCA1 (SWI/SNF) that were differentially expressed between Golden Retrievers with hemangiosarcoma and other breeds with hemangiosarcoma.

PMC5644640,Figure 1,"Summary of potential beta adrenergic signaling pathways in canine hemangiosarcoma and human angiosarcoma. Although several other pathways and transcription factors are regulated through beta adrenergic signaling, pathways currently described or thought to be active in hemangiosarcoma and angiosarcoma cells are presented. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are delivered into the tumor microenvironment through the circulation and potentially from local sympathetic nerve fibers. The catecholamines bind to β-ARs, causing Gαs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase and the generation of cAMP from ATP. Intracellular cAMP activates two major biochemical signaling pathways (1) protein kinase A (PKA) and (2) exchange protein activated by adenylyl cyclase (EPAC). Activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of multiple protein targets, such as transcription factors (e.g., CREB) and the beta adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK). BARK recruits β-arrestin, which inhibits beta adrenergic signaling and activates Src kinase. Although not shown, Src kinase is known to activate other transcription factors (e.g., STAT3) and the downstream focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in other cancers. The activation of EPAC leads to the activation of the B-Raf/ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and affects the AP1 and Ets family of transcription factors. In general, the transcriptional responses potentially attributed to β-AR activation in angiosarcomas and hemangiosarcomas include the upregulation of genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation.

PMC5644640,Figure 2,"Beta adrenergic signaling drives essential processes in tumor initiation and progression in canine hemangiosarcomas and human angiosarcomas. (A) Norepinephrine (NE) is released by the sympathetic nervous system in the bone marrow, where it binds to β-AR and causes a decrease in the release of CXCL12 within hematopoietic stem cell niches. Reductions in CXCL12 levels lead to increased hematopoiesis. In hemangiosarcomas, DNA damaging events may occur at the level of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells leading to the generation of hemangiosarcoma progenitor cells. Increased levels of NE, might then promote the release of hemangiosarcoma cells into the circulation. Inhibition of NE activity by β-AR antagonists could limit disease progression by restoring CXCL12 levels and regulation of the bone marrow microenvironment; (B) Hemangiosarcoma cells released into the circulation may exist as progenitor cells or more differentiated tumor cells. The hemangiosarcoma cells express CXCR4 receptors, which promote tumor cell homing to tissue sites that express high levels of CXCL12. S1P may also be produced by RBCs and platelets in the circulation and in tissues to further promote homing and tumor cell dissemination; (C) The secretion of proangiogenic and proinflammatory factors by hemangiosarcoma cells promotes the formation of the tumor cell niche. NE and epinephrine (E) released locally by sympathetic nerve fibers or found circulating in the blood may further activate tumor cells and promote tumor initiation and growth; (D) Tumor cells possess the ability to hijack the metabolic processes of normal cells, such as adipocytes, present within the surrounding local environment. Activation of β-AR on adipocytes by locally produced or circulating NE and E can lead to the further production and release of angiogenic and inflammatory factors, promoting tumor growth. Upon beta adrenergic stimulation, adipocytes release fatty acids into the tumor microenvironment, which can then serve as a metabolic fuel for tumor cells or for the production of essential metabolites needed for efficient tumorigenesis. Potential areas in this process where β-AR antagonists may slow or halt tumorigenesis are indicated.",vetsci-02-00270-g002,Match,NotMatch

Canine hemangiosarcoma is thought to originate from hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Chromosome translocations and a reactive microenvironment are suggested as potential genetic and biological events that may transform the hemangiosarcoma progenitor cells. Interleukin (IL)-8, produced by hemangiosarcoma cells, is thought to modulate the tumor microenvironment, promoting the growth and survival of tumor cells. CXCR4 and its ligand, CXCL12, found to be abundant in hemangiosarcoma tissue, transduce biological signaling, causing tumor cells to increase their motility to migrate and invade into the other sites for metastasis. Canine hemangiosarcoma cells that consume Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) from the tumor microenvironment induce intracellular signaling through S1P receptor-1 (S1P1), increasing cell growth and survival.

Regarding eBAT, since the native binding domain has been removed, the molecule binds via epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or amino-terminal fragment (ATF) to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), respectfully. eBAT is internalized in endocytotic vesicles. The toxin contains a natural translocation region (T), translocates the membrane, and is released, where it either traffics to the Golgi or continues to lysosomes for terminal degradation. In the Golgi, PE that is engineered to express C-terminal KDEL encounters KDEL receptors, giving cause to transport PE to the endoplasmic reticulum in a retrograde manner. The toxin fragment containing the catalytic domain is subsequently transported into the cytosol, where it catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of elongation-2 factor, a vital component of protein synthesis. This is a catastrophic ribosomal event that results in cellular apoptotic cell death. DTIL-2 follows a very similar mechanism of action but is internalized in acidified vesicles.",biomolecules-10-00956-g001,NotMatch,NotMatch
