Routine mammography was performed and this showed two well-defined nodular densities in left upper central quadrant. C, D. Breast US was performed on first visit three years previously (C). US demonstrated presence of three well-defined, oval-shaped, homogenously hypoechoic masses within skin layer (white stars), with sizes of 9 × 4 mm, 8 × 5 mm and 4 × 2 mm, and mild posterior acoustic enhancement. As compared to previous US, current breast US (D) shows presence of masses that have apparently increased in size in skin and subcutaneous layer. Maximum diameter of masses had increased from 9 to 17 mm and from 8 to 9 mm. More importantly, three masses are surrounded by echogenic lines (white arrows) that represent dermal layer. This appearance suggests cutaneous lesion. E-H. Breast MRI demonstrates well-defined masses in left breast with low signal intensity on axial T1-weighted images (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]: 4.6/1.7) (E), intermediate- to low-signal intensity on T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) images (TR/TE: 3800/90) (F), high signal intensity on turbo inversion recovery magnitude image (TIRM, TR/TE/inversion time [TI]: 5620/88/230) (G), and fat-suppressed gadolinium-enhanced T1-wighted image shows masses with homogeneous enhancement and linear structure that is biopsy needle track from skin to masses (H).
