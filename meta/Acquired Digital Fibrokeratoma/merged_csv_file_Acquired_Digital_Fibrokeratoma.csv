The excision site of the cellular digital fibroma has completely healed when the sutures were removed at the follow up visit 2 weeks after the excisional biopsy (a). There is superficial desquamation of the epidermis surrounding the excision site and the surgical scar is faintly visible 3 weeks after the procedure was performed (b).
