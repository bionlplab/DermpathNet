Distant (a, c) and closer (b), plantar (a, b) and lateral (c) views of a new asymptomatic flesh-colored 5 mm papule on the lateral side of the left great toe of a 61-year-old man. The lesion had been present for 18 month and had been enlarging slowly until it stopped growing 4 months ago. There had been no trauma to the site",13555_2020_418_Fig1_HTML

Distant (a) and closer (b–d) views of the cellular digital fibroma show characteristic pathologic features. The hematoxylin and eosin (a–c) stained sections show compact orthokeratosis and acanthosis of the epidermis. In the predominantly collagenous dermis, there is a tumor composed of spindle-shaped fibroblasts and minimal myxoid stroma. Neither cellular atypia nor mast cells are noted. The CD34 stained section shows diffuse and strong staining of the entire dermal tumor (hematoxylin and eosin: a × 2; b, × 4; c × 10; CD34: d, × 10)",13555_2020_418_Fig2_HTML

There is superficial desquamation of the epidermis surrounding the excision site and the surgical scar is faintly visible 3 weeks after the procedure was performed (b). There has been no recurrence of the cellular digital fibroma at 5 months follow up,13555_2020_418_Fig4_HTML
