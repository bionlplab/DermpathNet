Contrast-enhanced CT scan obtained at the same level as in B depicts an elongated highly enhanced (105-160 H) mass (short arrows) extending into the spinal canal (arrowheads). Due to the greater proportion of fatty tissue it contains, the focal area of low attenuation observed on noncontrast CT scan shows a mild degree of enhancement (long slender arrow).D.

The surgical site in the floor of the mouth was reconstructed using circumferential tissue, a technique that involves the strategic placement of tissue to mimic the original anatomical structure. This method was employed to restore the mouth floor to its normal function and appearance. Following the procedure, the wound underwent a healing process known as secondary intention. This process allows the wound to heal naturally from the inside out, without the need for sutures or other closure methods. The image provides a visual representation of circumferential tissue used to approximate for healing by secondary intention and the successful reconstruction of the mouth floor.",etm-26-03-12157-g02

The mass (~3.5 cm) is characterized by a well-defined encapsulation, a protective layer that often surrounds such growths. This encapsulated lesion was carefully excised, ensuring minimal disturbance to the surrounding tissues. Along with the lesion, an adjacent tissue sample, often referred to as a ‘trapdoor’ sample due to its shape and method of extraction, was also removed. Both the excised lesion and the trapdoor sample were subsequently sent for pathological examination. This step is crucial for confirming the diagnosis and understanding the nature of the lesion in greater detail.",etm-26-03-12157-g03

(A) The evaluation revealed a large fibrous stroma, a connective tissue framework, encapsulating fatty tissue. Of note, this fatty tissue did not exhibit any signs of atypia, suggesting the absence of abnormal or dysplastic cells. Within this fatty tissue, a significant proliferation of capillaries was observed, indicating an active blood supply to the area (arrow). (B) These capillaries were found to contain fibrin thrombi (arrow), clots formed by fibrin proteins, and exhibited fibrofatty changes. These changes typically involve the replacement or transformation of normal tissue structures with fibrous and fatty tissues. The image provides a detailed visual representation of these pathological findings (haematoxylin and eosin stain; magnification, x100; scale bars, 100 µm).",etm-26-03-12157-g04
