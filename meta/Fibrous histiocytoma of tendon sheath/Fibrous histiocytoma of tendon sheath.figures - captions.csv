Through circulation, FGF23 is transferred to the kidney, where it interacts with the FGFRs in the presence of co-receptor Klotho[26]–[28], decreasing the expression of an electrogenic phosphate transporter (sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2a, NaPi-2a)[29],[30] and an electroneutral phosphate transporter (NaPi-2c) on the apical surface of the proximal tubule and leading to inhibition of renal phosphate reabsorption and 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis[15],[27]. This results in phosphaturia and reduced intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate, eventually decreasing the plasma Pi (inorganic phosphate) and resulting in hypophosphatemia[31]. On the other hand, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates while FGF23 inhibits 1,25(OH)2D3 production in the kidney[11],[32]. In turn, 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits PTH production and secretion from the parathyroid glands and stimulates FGF23 production from the bone as a negative feedback mechanism[33],[34]. FGF23 can also decrease PTH secretion, and PTH can decrease the expression of NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c[35].

Following the diagnosis of a well-differentiated follicular thyroid carcinoma, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy and subsequent Iodine-131 [131I] remnant ablation, receiving an activity of 3.7 GBq. Five days after [131I] administration, the post-therapy scan showed mild uptake in the thyroid remnant and a more intense focus of uptake, probably secondary to a thyroglossal duct remnant (A, arrowhead). To assess the possibility of a TGCT relapse, we did a palmar planar image of both forearms, wrists and hands (B), which showed mildly increased uptake in the distal third of the radial forearm, wrist and metacarpal spaces (B, arrow) a more evident in the single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images (C, arrow). Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fused SPECT/MRI images (D: Coronal SPECT-MRI; E: Coronal MRI) revealed increased signal on fat suppression with short-time inversion recovery (STIR) coronal sequence concordant with the increased uptake in SPECT (arrows in D and E). The histological examination was consistent with the TGCT. The patient did not present with any clinical side effect secondary to radioiodine treatment, or any clinical sign or symptom in the right upper limb after one-year follow-up. TGCT is an orphan, mono-articular and potentially locally aggressive disease that occurs in a localized form, which involves a discrete section of the synovium, or in a diffuse form, which involves the entire synovium (1,2,3). The diffuse type has high recurrence rates and poor functional outcomes (1,2,4). TGCT is characterized by hypervascular neoplastic proliferation of the synovium with deposition of macrophages, multinucleated giant cells and hemosiderin (3). The proposed reasons for iodine increased uptake in non-thyroid tumors are an expression of sodium iodide symporter, augmented vascularity and enhanced capillary permeability, which can be caused by inflammation secondary to the tumor (5,6,7). MRI is the most distinctive imaging technique in diagnosing and treating TGCT (1,2,3,8). It reflects the existence of hemosiderin-laden tissue that applies a paramagnetic effect decreasing T1 and T2 relaxation times, leading to low to intermediate signal intensity in T1 and T2 weighted spin-echo sequences. On STIR sequences, the effect is overstated because of increased magnetic susceptibility deriving in areas of very high signal intensity (3,8). The main treatment modality is resection for naïve and relapsed TGCT. Radiation therapy and targeted therapies, mainly with monoclonal antibody inhibiting colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (pexidartinib) are promising, and both should be considered especially in case of relapse (1,2,3,4,8). However, in our patient’s case, watchful waiting was finally decided, mostly because of age, relative good mobility, and the stability of the tumor on serial MRI. A considerable number of cases of unexpected radioiodine uptake have been reported and some of which were in the limbs (6). To our knowledge, this report is the first in the literature of a TGCT visualized in the post-therapy radioiodine scan.",MIRT-31-145-g1

PMC9244941,Graphical Abstract Legend,"Schematic representation of the main available tools for myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and translational research. MFS most commonly occurs in adults and presents as an intramuscular mass, typically located in limbs. Diagnosis mainly relies on histopathological analysis (IHC) and imaging (MRI), however in recent years also NGS proved helpful in detecting distinct molecular alterations. Prognosis has been shown to correlate with specific gene expression signatures, as well as with immune microenvironment markers and infiltrating cells. The cornerstone of treatment for localized disease is surgical resection, possibly in combination with radiotherapy, while in metastatic MFS the standard systemic treatment is based on anthracycline chemotherapy, targeted therapy such as TKIs and CDKIs or immunotherapy. In order to gain better insight on the still poorly understood pathogenesis and behaviour of MFS, several in vitro cell cultures and in vivo xenograft models have been established, representing promising tools for the improvement of MFS management.",10.1177_17588359221093973-fig1

A 62-year-old man presented himself to the referral doctor in 2018 for unspecified pain in his left arm. After an orthopedic specialist consultation, it was decided to perform a CT scan with and without contrast medium in an attempt to localize the lesion. The medical history was silent for other pathologies and/or neoplasms. Both total body CT and regional Magnetic Resonance highlighted the presence of an oval formation in the lateral belly of the brachial triceps, measuring 46 × 17 mm, with a mixed content including blood. The lesion seemed encapsulated, with some antero-external irregularities (Figure 1). At pre-operative angiography, intense peripheral vascularization was observed, without any apparent infiltration. Furthermore, PET scan showed areas of incremented radiopharmaceutical accumulation in the belly of the left brachial triceps muscle (SUV max 6.5). It was therefore decided to perform a first cytological aspiration with a fine needle, the results of which were constituted by blood material comprising numerous pigmented histiocyte/macrophage cells. Three months later, a biopsy was performed at the level of the lesion in question which, however, was not conclusive for any diagnosis. Following this report, it was decided to perform surgical removal of the formation and the finding was evaluated by the histopathologist.",diagnostics-12-02616-g001
PMC9689933,Figure 2,"The histopathological analysis allowed to appreciate a lesion characterized by a peripheral fibrous pseudocapsule, not continuous, and by a large central cystic-haemorrhagic portion, consisting of medium-sized cellular elements (A), partly epitheliomorphs, sometimes with clarified cytoplasm (B), and in some areas spindle, mostly monomorphic, with evident eosinophilic nucleoli, with solid growth (B). A rich inflammatory infiltrate was described, also consisting of foamy histiocytes and hemosiderophages. The mitotic count was 2/10 high power field (HPF) and there were no areas of necrosis. The immunohistochemical reactions were positive for Desmin with a score of +++ (C), CD68 PG-M1 positive with a score of ++/− (D). Reactions for Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, Miogenin and MyoD1 and CD34 were negative. The fraction of neoplastic proliferation evaluated by Ki67 + was low, around 5–6%. The diagnosis of Angiomatoid Fibrous Histiocytoma (AFH) was then made and the patient was closely followed-up. After less than 6 months, the patient was again subjected to a surgical resection, whose histological sample was analyzed and found to be an intramuscular localization of AFH with free margins. After about 12 months, the patient returned to the referring physician with progressive febrile episodes and asthenia, as well as mild breathing difficulties. A new CT was performed which showed a thickening of about 0.8 cm. An apical resection of the upper lobe of the right lung (LSD) was performed.",diagnostics-12-02616-g002
PMC9689933,Figure 3,"(A,B) The histological analysis highlighted a lesion with morphological characteristics very similar to the previous AFH, although the organ location had changed.

Immunohistochemical investigations were again conducted which were positive for Desmin (D), CD68, with a Ki67 + of about 10–15%. A diagnosis of metastasis in the upper lobe of the right lung of AFH was made and the sample was sent for FISH investigation for diagnostic confirmation. Molecular analyzes revealed the presence of the EWSR1::CREB1 fusion gene. This feature was very important to confirm and start the therapeutic path [1,2,3]. Regarding the differential diagnosis, it is important to differentiate AFH from other types of dermatofibroma, or, in the case of prominent myxoid change, from other myxoid tumors such as low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma [4]. The case presented is of particular interest for three reasons: (1) AFH metastasis rate described in the literature is around 1–5%, with about 15 cases of AFH lung involvement described [5,6]; (2) from the few published cases of metastatic AFH, it would seem that the presence of the EWSR1::CREB1 fusion gene predisposes more aggressive behavior of the neoplasm [7]; careful follow-up with the possibility of performing a FISH in cases of relapsed AFH is mandatory [1,2,8,9,10,11,12].",diagnostics-12-02616-g003
