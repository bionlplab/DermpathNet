Anti-fibroblast activation protein alpha and routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained glass slides were scanned in a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0-HT scanner. They were used for quantitative, semiquantitative, and qualitative image analyses. A qualitative visual assessment of FAP-labeled tissue was performed by pathologists, and a semiquantitative FAP expression score was defined for each tumor. For automated quantitative image analysis using artificial intelligence, digitized slides were stored on a centralized server, and a direct link was established with the Visiopharm Integrator System (VIS) version 6.9.0.2779 (Visiopharm, Hørsholm, Denmark) platform. The first step of digital image analysis was the manual delineation of the regions of interest (ROIs). Each color represents one tissue type that was assessed separately. Automated tissue detection for segmentation and exclusion of artifacts (in gray) was performed. Automated visual detection and quantification of FAP labeling resulted in quantitative output measures. The algorithm for the different brown groups was designed so that it uses a pixel intensity thresholding for the level 1 (FAP-positive cells) weak immunoreactivity of 131–175 pixels; level 2, intermediate immunoreactivity (101–130 pixels); level 3, strong immunoreactivity (71–100 pixel); level 4, very strong immunoreactivity (<71 pixels). Pixel values above 176 were considered as background staining intensity (FAP-negative cells).
