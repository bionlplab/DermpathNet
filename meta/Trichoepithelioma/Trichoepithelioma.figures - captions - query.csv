HIF1 activation regulates the expression of several target genes whose products address the needs of oxygen starved cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), BCL-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and glycolytic enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). Hypoxia also influences mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling mainly mediated through hypoxic activation of the TSC1-TSC2 complex by REDD1. First, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI(3)K) and protein kinase B (AKT) have been implicated in the activation of the mTOR protein kinase. One critical target of AKT that regulates mTOR is the tumour suppressor protein, tuberin (TSC2). Tuberin negatively regulates mTOR signalling, and AKT activation circumvents this inhibition. Constitutive mTOR signalling positively stimulates S6 kinase (S6K), a downstream effector of mTOR pathway, which mainly drives cell growth and proliferation. Also, mTOR enhances the protein levels of HIF and consequently enhances the expression of HIF target genes. Second, under conditions of hypoxia, intracellular ATP levels drop and AMP levels rise. AMP directly binds to a subunit of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is then phosphorylated by serine/threonine protein kinase 11 (STK11/LKB1). Elevated concentrations of AMPK can cause a complete inhibition of mTOR (mTORC1) activity without affecting PI(3)K-AKT signalling.",pone.0106427.g001,NotMatch,NotMatch

In the non-canonical NF-kB signaling pathway, deubiquitination of Bcl-3 by CYLD results in the inhibition of cyclin D1 gene expression [29]. Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to be regulated by CYLD, via deubiquitination of the (disheveled) DVL protein [6]. The JNK signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be regulated by CYLD activity through unknown mechanisms likely involving TRAF2 and MKK7 [7].
