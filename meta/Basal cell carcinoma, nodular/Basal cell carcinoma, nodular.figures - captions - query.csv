TLS presence was defined as presence and co-localization of both CD3+ T cell and CD20+ B-cell along high endothelial venules in the dermis. TLS maturation was evaluated as dense lymphocytic aggregates composed primarily of T-cells with randomly distributed B-cells (aggregate TLS), CD20+ B-cell clusters with follicular dendritic cells and T-cells (primary TLS) and B-cell clusters showing germinal-center like maturation (secondary TLS). (B) Representative images of IHC staining for TLS with CD3+ T cells (brown) and CD20+ B (pink) with patterns indicating absence of TLS when lacking co-localization of T and B cells, presence of aggregate TLS when scattered loose aggregates of T and B-cells are seen in the dermis and presence of primary TLS when CD20+ B-cell initiate cluster formation and are surrounded by CD3+ T cells and dendritic cells. (C) Population pyramid displaying prevalence of TLS based on body site (upper panel) and BCC subtype components (bottom panel). A significant over-representation of TLS in lesions with nodular component was observed when compared to lesions without a nodular component (Odds Ratio = 10.29; p-value, fisher's exact test = 0.047). No significant difference was detected for TLS prevalence in lesions based on body site, gender, age or ulceration status; although lesions were less likely to have a TLS in the presence of ulceration compared to lesions showing no ulceration (Odds Ratio = 0.14; p-value, fisher's exact test = 0.1; see Table 2). (D) Box and whiskers plot showing the effect of TLS properties in different maturation stages (aggregate vs primary). Each data point represents individual TLS. More mature primary TLS show a greater amount of B cells (p-value for B cells <0.001), greater number of combined T and B cells (p-value = 0.006), larger TLS area (p-value = 0.001), and higher fraction of B cells compared to aggregate stages (p-value <0.001).

Infiltrating T and B cells inside annotated tumor boundaries were quantified and referred to as TILs. Tumor killing was defined as active tumor regression involving a combination of infiltrating immune cells along tumor periphery leading to disruption of the palisaded architecture and was graded as a binary variable for presence or absence. (B) Representative CD3/CD20 IHC images of TILs and tumor killing demonstrating CD3+ T cells (brown) and CD20+ B cells (pink) cells inside tumors (black encircled structures). Infiltrating CD3+ and CD20+ lymphocytes inside BCC tumors were referred to as TILs while infiltrating of immune cells along tumor edge that accompany a disrupted tumor border was referred to as tumor killing (green stars). (C) TILs distribution in tumors proximal to primary TLS, aggregate TLS and control cases (no TLS); data points represent individual tumors. Tumors proximal to primary TLS show significantly higher mean of TIL counts compared to tumors proximal to aggregate TLS (p-value < 0.001, approximated with Wald tests of the fixed effect in a linear mixed-effects model of Box-Cox transformed count of TILs, see Table 3).
