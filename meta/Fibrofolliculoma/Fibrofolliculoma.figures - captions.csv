PMC8409184,Figure 9,"Seven of the patient’s family members were genetically analysed. Seven of the patient’s family members were genetically analysed (I-1 was deceased), and the germline mutations in the folliculin gene mutation of the patients’ were derived from her mother. The source of her mother’s gene mutation could not be tracked due to the failure of the gene test in I-1. The patient, her mother, and her second maternal aunt had a similar genetic mutation, and the performance of their clinically affected organs was identical. ",WJCC-9-7123-g009
PMC8409184,Figure 10, The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics rating considered suggested the presence of PVS1 and PM2 by taking into consideration the suspected diseases. A: Genetic test revealed a heterozygous nucleotide variation (red arrow) of c.1285_1286insC in germline mutations in the folliculin gene of the patient; B: The patient’s mother; C: The patient’s second maternal aunt; D: No genetic variation (red arrow) was detected in her elder aunt; E: Her elder uncle; F: Her second uncle; G: Her grandmother. ,WJCC-9-7123-g010
