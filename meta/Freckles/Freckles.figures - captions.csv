PMC5858515,Figure 9," A proposed antimelanogenic mechanism of α-viniferin. α-MSH increases cAMP levels via melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase in melanocytes. cAMP binds to the regulatory (R)-subunit within PKA holoenzyme (R2C2), concomitantly unleashing the catalytic (C)-subunit for activation. On the other hand, the C-subunit of PKA reassociates with cAMP-free R-subunit, becoming an inactive complex, in the signal termination. α-Viniferin, an active constituent of C. sinica, primarily accelerates PKA inactivation via reassociation between C-subunit and R-subunit. This mechanism resultantly inhibits not only CREB phosphorylation, CRTC1 dephosphorylation but also nuclear translocation of CRTC1, thus down-regulating expression of MITF-M gene, a master transcription factor in cAMP-induced facultative melanogenesis.",thnov08p2031g010
