PMC6355473,Figure 4.,"New targeted therapies in advanced primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin is a drug composed of a chimeric anti-CD30 antibody linked to four monomethyl auristatin (MMAE) molecules (on average) (1). This antibody-drug conjugate first binds to CD30 on the surface of pcALCL cells (2). It is then internalized by a receptor-mediated endocytosis process (3 and 4). The resultant vesicle fuses with lysosomes (4), leading to proteolytic cleavage of the dipeptide linker and the presence of free MMAE molecules, which inhibit tubulin polymerization of the cellular cytoskeleton and arrest growth of pcALCL tumor cells. Gamma-secretase (γ-secretase) inhibitors prevent release of intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN1) from membrane-tethered heterodimeric NOTCH1 protein. This causes the downregulation of the tumor cell nuclear factor-kB (NFKB) pathway and the inactivation of survival genes. JAK1/2/3 inhibitors are effective in vitro for controlling pcALCL cell growth. This mechanism involves oncogenic JAK1 or STAT3 mutations associated with the hyperactive pSTAT3 shown in pcALCL with an NPM1-TYK2 gene fusion and oncogenic STAT3 activation. In addition, anti-ALK molecules such as crizotinib, alectinib, and ceritinib in pcALCL patients with ALK rearrangements could downregulate the STAT3 pathway, ultimately inducing tumor-cell death. IPH4102 is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the cellular receptor KIR3DL2 (CD158K). This receptor has been shown to be aberrantly expressed in advanced pcALCL. IPH4140 targets KIR3DL2 in tumor cells and promotes cell lysis after linking to the CD16 activating receptor through antibody-dependent, cell-derived cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells. At the epigenetic level, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and demethylating agents have demonstrated a degree of effectiveness at inducing cell-cycle arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis of tumor cells.",104226.fig4,Match,NotMatch
