A pre-contrast CT image shows a low-attenuated mass (arrow) with cystic changes in the pancreatic tail. A cyst with high attenuating inner content of up to 40 HU at the dependent level (asterisk) and up to 20 HU at the upper level, which is indicative of a hemorrhagic cyst, is observed. On contrast-enhanced CT images, the arterial phase reveals a well-defined, homogeneously enhancing solid tumor with non-enhancing, cystic inner components (arrow). The portal venous phase shows persistent enhancement. The enhancement is less intense compared with the adjacent normal pancreas. The normal parenchyma surrounds the tumor on each margin (arrowhead), which indicates that the lesion is located within the intra-pancreatic area. The coronal reconstruction image shows the enhancing solid mass within the intra-pancreatic location.B. The peripheral solid portion is characterized by a mild high SI on T2WI and a mild low SI on T1WI, relative to the normal adjacent pancreas. The inner cystic portions are characterized by a high SI on T2WI and a low SI on T1WI. As shown on the CT image, the cyst with fluid-fluid level is characterized by a low SI on T1WI and T2WI at the dependent level (asterisks) and an intermediate SI on T1WI and a high SI on T2WI at the upper level, which suggests an older hemorrhage at the dependent portion. On the dynamic MRI, the periphery shows enhancement, but it is less intense than that of the normal pancreas on the arterial and portal phase images. The lesion shows a diffusion restriction on the peripheral solid portion on DWI (b = 1000).ADC = apparent diffusion coefficient, DWI = diffusion-weighted image, HU = Hounsfield unit, SI = signal intensity, T1WI = T1-weighted image, T2WI = T2-weighted imageC.

The histopathological specimen includes a lymphoid aggregate (asterisk) that is composed of spindle cells and is adjacent to the normal pancreas (arrowhead) (upper left; H&E stain, × 40). Cystic change and xanthogranulomatous cells are observed (arrowhead) (upper right and lower left; H&E, × 100; H&E, × 200).
