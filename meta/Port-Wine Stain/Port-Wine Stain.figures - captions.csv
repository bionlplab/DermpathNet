During the photothermal response, circulating thermosensitive liposomes (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC):1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-conjugated polyethylene glycol (DSPE-PEG), 10:85:5 molar ratio) loaded with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) at a self-quenched concentration (100 mM) were incorporated into the thermal coagulum and released their cargo. Raising the temperature above the phase transition temperature of the main phospholipid component (DSPC, Tm = 55.5 °C) results in liposomal membrane permeability and rapid CF release. Part of the CF is trapped within (or tethered to) the thermal coagulum. The CF becomes diluted that in turn causes fluorescence dequenching.",jclintranslres-5-001-g006

PMC6765152,Figure 9,"An overview of the differential photothermal responses to port wine stain (PWS) laser therapy and their respective vascular remodeling pathways in relation to clinical outcomes. Complete photo-occlusion (top pathway) most often results in vascular remodeling characterized by removal of the thermally afflicted vasculature followed by limited angiogenesis and/or neovasculogenesis. Inasmuch as the total dermal blood content is significantly reduced, these processes typically result in good clinical clearance after the vascular remodeling phase (“clinical outcome” panel, illustrating the changes in skin color before (left) and after (right) treatment). In the case of extensive angiogenesis or neovasculogenesis following laser treatment (middle pathway), the reduction in dermal blood volume is limited, corresponding to a moderate clinical result. Alternatively, particularly in refractory PWSs, light penetration is insufficient to induce complete photocoagulation of the vascular lumen, resulting in partial occlusion of the target vessels by a thermal coagulum (bottom pathway). During the remodeling phase, the thermal coagulum is either removed by recruited immune cells or becomes part of the vascular wall, leading to luminal thinning (small opposing arrows). This damage profile is associated with minimal reduction in dermal blood volume and hence poor clinical outcome.",jclintranslres-5-001-g009

After induction of drug release, for example, by mild hyperthermia generated by a second laser pulse (d), the thrombomodulators and antifibrinolytic agents are activated/released.

PMC8659408,Figure 2,"Principles of PAT and major implementations. (a) Imaging principle of PAT. When a short laser pulse is fired at the biological tissue, some photons are absorbed by biomolecules, and their energy is converted into heat through the nonradiative relaxation of excited molecules. The local temperature rise induces a local pressure rise, which propagates as an acoustic wave through the tissue and reaches an UT or UTA. The received signals are used to form an image that maps the original optical energy deposition inside the tissue.
