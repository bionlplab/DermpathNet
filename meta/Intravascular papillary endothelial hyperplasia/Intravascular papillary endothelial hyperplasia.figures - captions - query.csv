In A3, loop segmented in capillary-like structures, acquiring the capillary aspect of LCH. These images only represent one loop. Spatially, however, multiple converging loops occur in the lesion, and the capillary-sized spaces may connect with others in other loops. These findings could explain the future conservation or involution of these spaces. Note that the ITS surrounded by the loop remains outside the mother vessel (extravascular). (B) Several steps of pillar formation in the mother vessel are shown in B1, B2 and B3, with their corresponding microphotographs. The loop originating from the mother vessel (B1) becomes permeable (B2), and the ITS and its surrounding endothelium (internal side of the loop) is transported to the mother vessel lumen (although some connections between the pillar and vessel wall may persist). In B3, several pillars can be arranged linearly or irregularly, originating the sinusoidal-hemangioma-like (B3a) or IPEH-like (B3b) pattern, respectively.",41598_2020_61921_Fig8_HTML,NotMatch,NotMatch

PMC10157200,Figure 1,"Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological imaging. (A) Left-to-right, each row includes T2- and T1-weighted images (w.i.) and histological features at precise time points. First row, Time 0 (onset): a large intra-axial hemorrhagic (T1 spontaneous hyperintensity) lesion surrounded by edema (T2 hyperintensity) is visible in the right frontal-parietal region. View of Masson Trichrome stain (original magnification x20) showing partially organized hematoma surrounded by granulation tissue. Second row, Time 3 months: three small, new intracranial hemorrhagic lesions with extensive edema are noted. The left frontal lesion, shown in the figure, was removed and underwent a histopathological examination, which is concluded as a hemangioendothelioma (HE); in particular, the tissue morphology was characterized by papillary structures covered by a single endothelial cell layer, expressing the endothelial-specific markers, as CD31 (x20). Third row, Time 4: a new left frontal hemorrhagic mass is documented; histology with Masson Trichrome (x20) revealed the fibrous wall of hematoma and an area consisting of vascular proliferation with papillary architecture compatible with HE. Fourth row, Time 20: a new right hemispheric cerebellar hemorrhagic lesion associated with mass effect is found. Low-magnification (x10) view of the hematoxylin and eosin stain of the lesion shows only a partially organized hematoma. Fifth row, Time 80: the figure shows a new large hemorrhagic mass in the left parasagittal frontal region surrounded by edema. Hematoxylin and eosin stain (x20) demonstrate a compact network of papillary structures with a collagenous axis, suggestive of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH, Masson's tumor). (B) Times 87 (left) and 89 (right): T2* w.i. (top row) show that three further lesions with hemosiderin deposition (T2* hypointensities) without recent-bleed hyperintensity in T1 w.i.
