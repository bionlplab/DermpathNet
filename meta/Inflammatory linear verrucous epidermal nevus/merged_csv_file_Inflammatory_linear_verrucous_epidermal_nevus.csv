Single hemichannel currents were recorded in response to 8-s voltage ramps between −70 and +70 mV. Current-voltage relations for Cx43-A44V and Cx43-E227D were linear, whereas those of Cx43-G8V showed slight inward rectification. All three mutations show closing transitions to subconductance states. Occasional transitions to the fully closed state are also seen (b). (d) Cell-attached patches from wild-type Cx43 injected oocytes failed to show single channel activity. (e) Mean slope conductances measured at Vm = 0 are similar for the three mutant hemichannels.

Representative examples of recordings from a Cx43-E227D expressing oocyte in a cell-attached patch configuration containing one to two open channels at voltages ranging from −110 to +70 mV. Cx43-E227D hemichannels were predominantly open at inside positive voltages. Occasional closures to subconductance states were observed at high positive voltages. In contrast, Cx43-E227D hemichannels showed voltage-dependent closures to negative voltages. While channels are predominantly open at −30 mV, dwell times in the open state decreased with hyperpolarization to −50, −70 and −90 mV. Residence in subconductance states or the fully closed state was favored at the more hyperpolarized voltages. The zero current level, i.e. the fully closed state (C), the current levels of one (O1) or two fully open hemichannels (O2) and that of the subconductance state (S) are depicted by dotted lines. The zero current level was determined as described in Methods.",41598_2018_37221_Fig6_HTML
