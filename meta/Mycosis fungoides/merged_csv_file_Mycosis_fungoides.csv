Nonpermissive heterodimers: RXR/RAR (or high affinity hormone receptor) mediate repression in the absence of ligand due to interaction with transcriptional corepressors SMRT and N-CoR and associated histone deacetylases. Repression is abrogated by the interaction of the RAR ligand, but not the RXR ligand, due to the requirement for corepressor displacement mediated by ligand-induced conformational change in the RAR protein. 3.

In CTCL, the TCR signaling cascade that normally leads to FASL upregulation is blocked by high c-CBL levels. When c-CBL is inhibited, signaling is restored and FASL increases. This leads to apoptosis if there is adequate FAS death receptor expression. If FAS is low, then MTX can be used to derepress the FAS promoter leading to FAS upregulation and subsequent apoptosis. With this approach, both FAS-high and FAS-low CTCL cells can be killed.",nihms-619130-f0003

Exposure of neutrophils to proteins from Bacillus oleronius leads to neutrophil chemotaxis, degranulation, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β). The aberrant immune response leads to destruction of hair follicles and development of FM, which presents clinically as papules or plaques on the skin, mimicking MF.",gr4

Each phase of cancer immunoediting can be associated with specific cellular and cytokine profiles. In the elimination phase (A), the immune system, depicted here by cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes and Natural Killer (NK) cells, controls the proliferation of malignant T-cells, keeping them occult/incognito. Several evidences suggest that HMF remains in the equilibrium phase (B). Specifically, CD8+ tumor-infiltrating cells (TILs) secrete TIA1, granzyme B, and granulysin, which are cytotoxic granules that induce apoptosis in malignant T-cells. The production of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α TNF-α by keratinocytes and TILs induce an active antitumor immune response. A low level of regulatory T-cell (Treg) infiltration reported in HMF suggests that TILs are able to induce apoptosis in malignant T-cells. Finally, in the escape phase (C), a shift to Th2 cytokine profile allows malignant cells to overcome immune recognition and proliferate in the skin and beyond.

In normal skin, keratinocytes produce basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and stem cell factor (SCF). The binding of bFGF to FGF receptor (FGFR) in melanocytes activates the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, while the binding of SCF to its cognate receptor CD177 in melanocytes upregulates microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF) and additional melanocyte molecules, leading to melanogenesis. Both pathways lead to melanocyte growth and survival. In HMF, cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes, which act as part of the antitumor immune response, releasing granulysin and granzyme B, combined with the Th1 inflammatory response rich in TNF-α, result in damage to keratinocytes and melanocytes. This damage to keratinocytes leads to a decreased level of the melanocyte molecules bFGF and CD117, among others. Without the signals needed for melanocyte growth/survival and in the presence of granzyme B, granulysin, and TNF-α, HMF skin eventually has fewer and damaged melanocytes, abnormal melanogenesis, and apoptotic melanocytes. These features lead to the characteristic pigment loss of HMF. Figure created with BioRender.com.",cancers-12-02007-g003

Malignant T-cell signaling pathways frequently deregulated in MF/SS cases that can drive the pathogenesis and progression of the disease and its potential targeted inhibitors. TCR/PLCγ1–NFAT/AP-1: upon stimulation with the antigen (a), TCR activates PLCγ1, which catalyzes the formation of IP3 and DAG. IP3 promotes Ca2+ release, which activates calmodulin (CaM), which, in turn, activates calcineurin (CaN). CaN dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT, which can associate with the transcription factor complex AP-1 to induce gene expression. DAG activates PKCs (including PKCθ), which, in turn, induces the activation of MAPKs (and the AP-1 complex) and NF-κB signaling pathways. CCR4/CCR7-MAPKs/NF-κB: CCL17/22 and CCL19/21 activate CCR4 and CCR7, respectively, which can trigger the activation of downstream effectors such as MAPK–ERK, mediating gene transcription via AP-1 and NF-κB, and RhoA, which regulates cytoskeletal dynamics. TNFR–NF-κB: NF-κB can also be activated downstream of membrane receptors such as TNFR. IL-R/JAK–STAT: JAK–STAT signaling pathway can be activated downstream of transmembrane receptors such as interleukin receptors. JAK kinases are constitutively associated with the intracellular tails of the receptor. Upon activation of the receptor, JAKs are tyrosine-phosphorylated, making them catalytically active and capable of recruiting members of the STAT family and phosphorylating them at tyrosine residues. Upon phosphorylation, STATs form dimers that translocate to the nucleus, where they act as transcription factors for inducing gene expression. All of these pathways converge in inducing the expression of genes involved in the pathophysiology of malignant T-cells, such as IL-2, IL-4, L-17, FOXP3, GATA3, and CCR4.

IL-12 has been indirectly restoring the cytotoxic mediated CD8(+) answer and promoting tumour regression by stimulating the differentiation of pre-T-helper 1 lymphocytes. IL-23 can stimulate pre-T-helper 1 lymphocytes, followed by creating T-helper 17 cells subset and increased secretion of IL-17 proinflammatory cytokines. MF cell is also able to secrete IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17A/IL-17F heterodimers. It is reinforced by upregulated JAK3/STAT3 pathway, which has been shown to be promoted by activated T-cell receptor (TCR), which is necessary for malignant transformation in MF to occur. One of the possible ways of activating TCR is related to Staphylococcal enterotoxin A. NF-kB upregulation, with its anti-apoptotic effect on lymphoma cells, seems to be important and relevant in the pathogenesis of CTCL. It has been promoted by TNF-α as well as proinflammatory IL-17 cytokines. IL-25 (IL-17E) is promoting STAT6 pathway. Those interactions result in increased IL-13 secretion (also in autocrine manner). Especially in the advanced stage of the disease it contributes to forming Th-2 cytokine profile, what results in decreased cytotoxic immunosurveillance and tumour growth",PDIA-38-44623-g001

Cutaneous bacteria, B. safensis in this study, are taken up by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as Langerhans cells (LCs) that migrate to the local lymph node in order to present antigens to circulating T cells. Next, activated T cells are recruited to the skin via the skin homing markers CLA and CCR4. The direct antigen contact in the epidermis potentially triggers T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion activating STAT3 phosphorylation, thereby inducing a progressive inflammatory response that supports the malignant transformation of cutaneous T cells. Additional inflammatory events mediated by other microbiota (such as staphylococci, indicated by S. aureus) likely fuel this process, resulting in the formation of Pautrier’s microabscesses and ultimately promoting the progression of the T cell malignancy.

(a) An early stage of a CTCL is shown in the first panel. There is a domination of T helper 1 (Th1) microenvironment with the contribution of IL-17, which plays role in promoting cytotoxic answer against extracellular pathogens (bacteria and fungi). Staphylococcal enterotoxins (superantigens) promote immunological dysregulation by causing benign lymphocytes to stimulate malignant clones. IL-17 has also been shown to promote the oncogenic pathway by stimulation janus kinase 3 (JAK3), which activates signal transducer and activator 3 (STAT3). (b) A late stage of CTCL is presented in the second panel. A clear domination of T helper 2 (Th2) microenvironment has been shown. The secretion of IL-17 may be reduced in that stage leading to local immunosuppression. Also, the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been shown to be reduced and dysfunctional in CTCL. In case of microbiota colonization of the skin, dysfunction of AMPs is one of the crucial elements of impaired skin function. Angiogenesis is signed with a question mark on this figure, because of a possibility, that IL-17 may promote formation of new vessels thorough all stages of the disease.

Haematoxylin counterstain (purple) was used for segmentation of the cell nuclei (B). Single-cell-based analyses were conducted using the segmented nuclei (black border) as a prerequisite for cell detection in the open-source software QuPath. First, we subclassified cells as “neoplastic lymphocytes” (tumor compartment, red), “stroma cells” (green) (including reactive T cells) or other cell types (comprising epidermal cells and skin appendages, yellow) using QuPath´s machine learning features and user-defined examples (C). We further subclassified cells of the three different categories using intensity thresholds in the DAB-channel in a sequential procedure, color-coding CD4+ lymphocytes with a red overlay and CD4− lymphocytes with a blue overlay (D). Next, stroma cells were further subclassified into CD4+ reactive lymphocytes (anthracite) and other stroma cells (olive green) (E).

A In psoriasis, autoantigens, including self-nucleotides bound to antimicrobial peptides released from keratinocytes, stimulate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) to produce interferons (IFN) that activate myeloid dendritic cells (mDC). mDCs secrete IL-12 and IL-23, which drives the development and proliferation of T helper 17 (Th17), T helper 22 (Th22), and T helper 1 (Th1) cells. Numerous inflammatory cytokines are produced, including IL-17, which binds to receptors on keratinocytes and activates an inflammatory feed-forward cycle that leads to upregulation of chemokines, cytokines, autoantigens, and angiogenic factors. IL-22 promotes keratinocyte hyperplasia. B In MF, the early stage of disease is characterized by an abundance of Th1 cytokines produced from Th1 cells and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc), which act to suppress malignant T-cells. As the disease progresses, there is a shift to a Th2-dominated microenvironment, which allows tumor cells to escape from anti-tumor immunity. Some malignant T-cells upregulate IL-17, which stimulates keratinocytes to release chemokines, cytokines, and angiogenic factors. IL-22, produced by benign T-cells in the microenvironment, stimulates epidermal hyperplasia and may promote tumor invasion and metastasis. The pathogenesis of both psoriasis and MF involves chronic inflammation, T-cell activation, leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and keratinocyte hyperplasia.

Silicon phthalocyanine (Pc 4), methyl aminolevulinic acid (MAL), 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), and hypericin are the photosensitizers used in experimental lymphoma cell studies or clinical studies. After light absorption, the photosensitizer (PS) is excited to a singlet state (1PS) and undergoes intersystem crossing to the excited triplet state (3PS). The excited triplet PS transfers its electrons to the neighbor biomolecules or oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROSs), superoxide anion radical (O2•−), and hydroxyl radical (OH•) (Type I reaction) and/or by a Type II reaction through direct energy transfer to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) to return to the ground state PS.
