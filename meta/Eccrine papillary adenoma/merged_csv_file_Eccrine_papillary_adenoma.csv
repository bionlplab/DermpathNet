Epidermis (×200): positive staining for GATA3 is present in the basal and spinous layers of the epidermis but is absent in the granular cell layer. Pilosebaceous unit (×100): positive staining for GATA3 is seen in both the outer root sheath of the hair follicle and in the sebaceous glands. Hair bulb and root sheath (×100): strong positive staining for GATA3 is present in some layers of the inner root sheath, with less intense staining also present in the outer root sheath, whereas the matrix cells of the hair bulb are negative for GATA3. Sweat glands (×200): apocrine glands (left) exhibit positive staining for GATA3, whereas eccrine glands (right) are negative for GATA3.",ajd-37-0885-g001
