(C) STSG from the patient’s upper back was used additionally for wound closure. (D) The three-month control shows a tumor-free and delighted patient.

(A) A 77-year-old male patient presented after resection of an AFX in an external hospital with positive margins in the frontotemporal area. (B) The patient was treated in a multistage approach, with temporary coverage to ensure tumor-free margins. The follow-up resection showed no residues of tumor tissue. (C,D) The resulting full-thickness scalp defect (middle) of 13.05 cm2 was closed using a triple-rhomboid flap.
