The patient underwent a combined wide local excision with negative margins and inguinal and parailiac lymph node dissection. The skin defect in the hip was reconstructed with a split skin graft. Pathologic examination demonstrated that the MM infiltrated into the entire dermis and metastasize into the lymph node. Two months later, magnetic resonance imaging showed soft tissue mass of 5x3.5x3 cm in size in the right pelvic region, considered conglomerate lymph nodes. The patient underwent surgery for this mass, and pathological examination revealed melanoma metastasis to the lymph node with extranodal soft tissue involvement. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, interferon, and radiotherapy. The patient died 12 months after the diagnosis of MM.Childhood MM is extremely uncommon, representing only 0.3%-0.4% of all melanomas in prepubertal children aged <15 years (1). Depending on the size of the lesion, CMN carries an increased risk for the development of childhood melanoma. Giant CMNs (>20 cm) have been reported to have increased risk of developing melanomas, particularly during the first and second decades of life (2). However, cutaneous melanomas rarely arise from small (≤1 cm) and medium (1.5-20 cm) CMNs. Risk factors for developing melanoma from a CMN include irregular borders, increased diameter, color change, surface ulceration, and bleeding. Cutaneous MM poses a high risk of dissemination to regional lymph nodes and visceral organs. Childhood MM is a potentially fatal disease. Accurate staging of patients with melanoma is especially important if clinically occult systemic metastasis is present, which may preclude them the benefit of a complex lymph node dissection for locoregional control (1). The most appropriate imaging approach for diagnosing and following pediatric patients with MM has been adopted usually from adult guidelines because of its rarity (3). In staging melanoma, 18F-FDG PET/CT is often employed to evaluate distant metastatic disease, as melanoma is very 18F-FDG avid (3). In addition to staging, PET/CT plays an important role in patient management, such as deciding on the extent of surgery, determination of radiation field, and evaluation of treatment response. The current case also underlines the importance of whole-body oncologic assessment by 18F-FDG PET scan in pediatric MM, which is a rare but a serious clinical entity.",MIRT-30-119-g3

MITF overexpression drives proliferation as expected, which is rescued by knockdown of C21orf91. Controls for both transfection with the MITF overexpression vector and the C21orf91 siRNA are included. Statistical significance was determined using a Student’s t-test (Prism v7.0, Graphpad). Statistically significant values are indicated by a single asterisk (p < 0.05), a double asterisk (p < 0.01), a triple asterisk (p < 0.001), or a quadruple asterisk (p < 0.0001). Increased expression of C21orf91 is associated with genetic dependency on MITF in melanoma cell lines. (h) CRISPR-Cas9 genome-scale knockout of MITF in melanoma cell lines (n = 30) reveals increased expression of C21orf91 in cells with greater MITF dependency, suggesting that C21orf91 is downstream of MITF. Dependency score as described in https://depmap.org. PR70 and C21orf91 are expressed throughout the cytoplasm with increased expression of C21orf91 in dividing cells. (i) Immunocytochemistry of SKMEL30-pTRIPZ-PPP2R3B in uninduced cells at 10× (A) and induced cells at 10× (B) and 20× (C) confirms increased PR70 and C21orf91 expression throughout the cytoplasm following induction of PPP2R3B. PR70 is stained with Alex Fluor® 488 (green) secondary antibody, and nuclei stained with Hoescht (blue) and in (C) Phalloidin (actin) are visualized with a conjugated Alex Fluor® 647 (far red) antibody. C21orf91 expression is increased in cells with two nuclei, which could be due to various causes including cell division or a cytokinesis defect 10× (D), 20× (E), 40× (F), stained with Alexa Fluor® 488 (green) secondary antibody, and Hoescht nuclear stain (blue). Scale bars represent 100 microns. RE: Inherited duplications of PPP2R3B promote nevi and melanoma via a novel C21orf91-driven proliferative phenotype.",41436_2021_1204_Fig5_HTML
