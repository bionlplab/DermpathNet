a Findings in superficial biopsy of tumour. Small nests (SN) and cords of basaloid cells showing a trabecular growth pattern. Several keratin-filled cysts (KC) and sebaceous glands (SG). No conclusive evidence of malignancy. Findings led to the misdiagnosis of a desmoplastic trichoepithelioma. H&E staining; magnification ×100. b Findings in deeper slices after complete tumour excision. Small, solid nests (SN) and cystic structures (CY). Growth pattern comparable to findings in (a).
