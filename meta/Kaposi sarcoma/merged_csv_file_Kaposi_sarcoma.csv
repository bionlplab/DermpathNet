HeLa cells were co-transfected with K5 and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)–expressing plasmid to identify transfectants. Then 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and stained with antibodies against MHC I, ALCAM, CD9, and CD29.

Also examined were mutant K5 proteins with enzymatically inactive RING-CH domains (K5-RING) or lacking acidic residues implicated in subcellular targeting (K5DE12). Neither K5 mutant reduced ALCAM levels. KSHV K3 was unable to downregulate ALCAM, whereas the myxomavirus M153R protein significantly reduced ALCAM surface expression. Two of the MARCH proteins, MARCH-IV and MARCH-IX, strongly downregulated ALCAM, while MARCH-VIII showed a minimal effect.(D) To determine whether ALCAM expression was affected by KSHV, latently infected immortalized DMVECs were treated with PMA to induce expression of lytic genes including K5. Surface levels of either MHC I or ALCAM were measured by flow cytometry 24 and 48 h post-induction. CD81, measured at 24 h, was used as a control.

Samples were resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF, and immunoblotted (WB) with the anti-ubiquitin (Ubi) antibody P4D1 (top) or anti-HA (bottom). Ubiquitinated ALCAM was visible upon co-transfection of K5 and MARCH-VIII, but not with the inactive K5DE12 mutant and the unrelated HIV immune modulator vpu.(B) To determine whether ubiquitinated ALCAM was degraded by proteasomes or in lysosomes, the fate of newly synthesized ALCAM-HA was determined by metabolic labeling for 10 min with S35 Met/Cys and chasing the label for the indicated times (hours) in the presence of the indicated inhibitors. Following lysis, ALCAM-HA was immunoprecipitated using the HA antibody and samples were treated overnight with endoglycosidase H followed by electrophoretic separation. Note the increased recovery of ALCAM at 8 h in the presence of the endosomal/lysosomal proton pump inhibitor concanamycin A (ConA), but not in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (50 μmol).(C) Surface expression of ALCAM can be restored by overexpressing a dominant negative version of the AAA-ATPase Vps4, which is essential for targeting proteins to MVBs.

A: Schematic representation of the experimental setup for the analysis of CpG methylation patterns. The KSHV episome in infected cells is expected to be partially methylated, as indicated by black and white circles which symbolize methylated or unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, respectively. Genomic DNA was isolated from such cells and the samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a methylcytidine specific antibody (MeDIP procedure), followed by hybridization of the precipitated samples versus the input on tiling microarrays. For each probe, an enrichment score ES was calculated, which represents the ratio of MeDIP over input fluorescence signals. The efficiency of the immunoprecipitation depends on the total number of methylated CpG motifs in a given fragment and ES is thus a function of the extend of methylation as well as local CpG frequencies. Therefore, to obtain reference values which signify maximum methylation for each probe, we generated a positive control by subjecting KSHV bacmids to CpG methylation in vitro. The bacmid was mixed with cellular DNA to simulate the host background and subjected to the same MeDIP procedure as samples from infected cells. Similarly, a negative control of unmethylated bacmid was prepared to control for cross-hybridization of unspecific background. After normalization of the array data using a spike-in control (see Material & Methods for details), background-corrected methylation values MS and MP were calculated for each probe by subtraction of the corresponding negative control value. B: Confirmation of successful in vitro methylation of KSHV bacmids used as a positive control. A bacmid carrying the complete KSHV genome (BAC36 [36]) was methylated using M.SssI, a methyltransferase specific for CpG dinucleotides. Methylated or unmethylated bacmids were subjected to restriction digestion using the methylation sensitive enzyme HpaII and its isoschizomer MspI, which cuts regardless of methylation. Methylated bacmids were resistant to HpaII digestion, signifying complete methylation.",ppat.1000935.g001

Levels were normalized to represent expression relative to ORF73, which is expressed during the latent as well as the lytic cycle. Compared to BCBL1, SLK-5dpi cells show little expression of lytic antigens, and expression was undetectable in SLKp cells. The detection of lytic transcripts in latent BCBL1 cultures is due to the low percentage (less than 1%) of cells which undergo spontaneous lytic reactivation. The percentage of lytic cells and thus transcript levels can be increased by treatment such as sodium butyrate (lower panel). Spontaneously reactivating cells are completely absent from SLKp cells, which is in accordance with the lack of detectable lytic gene expression.

Relative expression was determined for HEY1, Hey2 and PROX1 in primary HUAECs that were transduced with a control or PROX1-adenovirus for 48 hours. (E) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrating a physical association between PROX1 protein and the HEY1 promoter in LECs. Primary LECs were transfected with a control (LEC/CTR) or a PROX1-expressing vector (LEC/Prox1) for 48 hours and then subjected to ChIP analyses using a normal IgG (IgG) or anti-PROX1 (α-Prox1) antibodies. (F) A ∼0.6-kb HEY1 proximal promoter was sufficient to deliver the PROX1-mediated repression of HEY1 expression. Reporter constructs of the HEY1 promoter were transfected with a control or PROX1-expressing vector into HEK293 cells for 48 hours. (G) Ectopic expression of PROX1 in LECs resulted in downregulation of endogenous PROX1. LECs were transduced with a control (AdCTR) or PROX1 (AdProx1) adenovirus. After 48 hours, qRT-PCR was performed by using two sets of probes that target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of endogenous PROX1. All data were shown as a relative average expression ± standard deviation (SD).",ppat.1002770.g005

In PROX1-abundant LECs, the PROX1-repressive NOTCH pathway is more productive than the PROX1-inducing IL3Rα pathway, resulting in PROX1 downregulation and regaining BEC-phenotype (Reverse Reprograming).

Published data indicate that emmprin mediates critical pathogenic determinants for KSHV-infected cells, including cell migration/invasion, survival, and chemoresistance. Cell invasiveness is mediated through emmprin induction of MMPs and VEGF secretion which is itself dependent upon emmprin stimulation of ERK and Akt, possibly through emmprin-mediated secretion of hyaluronan and hyaluronan interactions with LYVE-1. Emmprin contributes to survival and chemoresistance for KSHV-infected tumor cells through its interactions with LYVE-1 and BCRP and efflux of chemotherapeutic agents. Emmprin stimulation of ERK and Akt may also maintain anti-apoptotic signaling. Whether interactions between emmprin and other known binding partners on the cell surface, including integrins, EP1-4, and MCTs mediate KSHV pathogenesis remains to be determined. Also, it remains unclear whether emmprin is involved in KSHV-induced EndMT through Notch pathways and MT1-MMP.

NF-κB hyper-activation by vFLIP promotes cell survival, but triggers a host checkpoint response mediated by p21 and p27 that arrests cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. KSHV vCyclin binds and activates Cdk6 to promote S phase entry. The vCyclin/Cdk6 complex prevents the G1 arrest caused by vFLIP, thereby facilitating chronic NF-κB activation and cell survival. However, vCyclin expression also causes DNA hyper-replication and activates the DNA damage response or other checkpoints, which likely become inactivated by other viral factors or cellular oncogenic alterations. (B) In HTLV-1 transformed cells, the senescence checkpoint response induced by Tax is inactivated by deregulation of G1 Cdks and Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27.

During KSHV lytic reactivation, free viral DNA in the cytosol is detected by host DNA sensors, such as cGAS and the Rad50/Mre11/CARD9 complex. The cGAS-STING cascade leads to IFN-β production, whereas the Rad50/Mre11/CARD9 complex is responsible for NF-κB cascade activation. A cross-talk between these two pathways may also be possible as indicated by the dashed arrows (Fig 6). Triggering of the Rad50/Mre11/CARD9 complex leads to the activation and nuclear accumulation of NF-κB p65 and the subsequent production of chemokines and cytokines. These events would interfere with the efficient KSHV lytic replication and therefore KSHV LANA ΔN isoforms block these signalling cascades by recruiting and inhibiting the upstream activators (cGAS as well as Rad50/Mre11).",ppat.1006335.g006

Memory B cells were further defined as CD38low/IgD-/CD27+, naïve B cells were CD38low/IgD+/CD27-, natural effector (Nat Effector) cells were CD38low/IgD+/CD27+ and germinal center (GC) cells were CD38hi/IgD-. (C) In similar infection experiments with four tonsil specimens, total RNA was extracted at 2, 4 and 6 days post-infection and viral gene transcription was verified in two technical replicates by RT-PCR. Replicate RT negative cDNA reactions for KSHV infected samples at 6 days post-infection were included as a control for DNA contamination and mean NRT Cq values (n = 8) for each target were as follows: 39.44 for LANA, 40.52 for ORF59 and >40 (not detectable) for K8.1. For a 40-cycle reaction, non-amplifying samples were set to Cq = 41 for the purposes of calculation. The lowest Cq value obtained in a mock infected sample was assigned as the limit of detection for each target, and data points that fall below this threshold are denoted with red shading. Yellow shading highlights values between 1.7 and 3.3 cycles lower than the limit of detection and corresponds to 5–10 fold increases in gene expression. Green shading highlights values more than 3.3 cycles lower than the limit of detection and corresponds to gene expression levels greater than 10-fold above the limit of detection.

Alterations in angiosarcoma (orange stars) include 1. Activating mutations in VEGFR2 (KDR), and amplification of VEGFR3 (FLT4), 2. A recurrent activating R707Q mutation in PLCG1, 3. Loss of function mutations in PTPRB, removing the inhibitory signal on Tie2, 4. Mutations in K-, H-, and N-RAS, BRAF, and MAPK1, and amplification of B- and C- RAF, and MAPK1. 5. Mice with loss of Tsc1 have constitutive activation of mTOR signaling and develop angiosarcoma. 6. C-MYC amplification is associated with radiation or lymphedema-induced angiosarcoma. The KSHV-derived LANA protein stabilizes HEY (6) leading to c-MYC transcription in KS cells, and stabilizes the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (7), leading to increased Notch-mediated signaling. The HIV-1 protein Tat binds to alpha-5-beta-1 and alpha-v-beta-3 integrin receptors and stimulates migration and invasion. Tat also stimulates the release of preformed, extracellularly bound bFGF into a soluble form that can induce vascular cell growth and prevent apoptosis, and Tat directly interacts with VEGFR2 leading to ligand independent activation of its downstream effectors (8). Expression of the lytic phase KSHV viral G-protein coupled receptor (vGPCR) leads to activation of the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways (9) which ultimately causes HIF-1a-mediated transcription of Notch-related proteins (10).

Imposition of full icosahedral symmetry led to the calculation of a map at 6.3 angstroms resolution (a). At each 5-fold symmetry axis, the CATC binds to peripentonal triplexes to form an assembly that lays over the major capsid protein penton (white arrow, a). A sharpened map reveals higher-resolution features and in particular the CATC five-helix bundle (d,e). Focussed classification led to the calculation of a C5 symmetric reconstruction at 7.7 angstroms resolution (b). This revealed the structure of the unique portal-vertex (white arrow, b). In the sharpened map, the CATC five-helix bundle is also well resolved (g,h). A close-up view of the penton-vertex highlights the structure of the CATC—in particular, the two globular densities that have been attributed to the C-terminal domain of pUL25 (black arrows, c). The CATC five-helix bundle is highlighted by fitting of atomic coordinates for this assembly (extracted from PDB 6CGR) (boxed region, d); pUL17 is shown as an orange ribbon; two copies of pUL25 (N-terminal domains) are shown in shades of blue; and two copies of pUL36 (C-terminal domains) are shown in shades of pink (e). The Ta triplex is indicated by a pink arrow (e). A close-up view of the portal-vertex shows that the 5-fold symmetry axis is capped by a tiered structure comprising two star-shaped rings of density (the PVAT, f). The arms of the CATC are also angled more towards the 5-fold axis. The sharpened map, viewed at a higher threshold, does not show the distal tier of the PVAT (g). Rigid body docking of CATC coordinates gave a good fit to the density and revealed a 6° counter-clockwise rotation of this assembly compared to that of the penton-vertex (compare e and h).

(A) Identification of EBV RNase R-resistant RNAs. Comparison of poly(A)+ RNA (PTLD9polyA+seq) and RNase R-treated RNA (PTLD9RnaseR+seq) from an EBV-positive PTLD sample (PTLD9) reveals RNase R-resistant RNAs that are potential BSJs of circRNAs. CIRI2 analysis using EBV Mutu genome KC207813 identified a minority of these reads to encode actual EBV BSJs (Table 1). An expanded view of the BART (RPMS1) region (146 kb to 150.2 kb) encoding the highest concentration of EBV BSJs revealed low mRNA but high RNase R-resistant RNA abundance. Standardized coverage depths (y axis) are indicated for each alignment. (B) EBV BART BSJ configurations. Shown is a diagram of the EBV BART mRNA coding region from exon II to exon IV. EBV circBART-BSJ1 (light blue) backsplices from exon IV to exon II, while BSJ2 (dark blue) backsplices from exon IV to exon IIIa, to generate circBART RNAs. EBV miRNA (mir)BART 7 to 22 miRNAs encoded by intron 2 are spliced out from the circBARTs. An expanded view of the BSJ2 region shows potential acceptor (blue square) and donor (purple circle) splice sites predicted by MaxEnt, with entropy scores given on the y axis. Divergent primers designed to verify BSJ1 and BSJ2 are shown in dark green (DP1) and light green (DP2), respectively. (C) Characterization of four circBART isoforms. Gel electrophoresis of DP2 RT-PCR products using EBV-positive PTLD6, BC1, and Akata RNAs shows four distinct bands corresponding to circBART_1.1 (711 nt), circBART_2.1 (609 nt), circBART_1.2 (501 nt), and circBART_2.2 (399 nt); circBART_1.1 and circBART_2.1 each contain the 210-nt intron 3a. ASOs targeting unique junction sequences are indicated by colored arrows. (D) The circBARTs are expressed in EBV-infected cell lines having different latency types. RNase R-treated (+) or RNase R-untreated (−) RNAs from cell lines having different latency forms were used for RT-PCR, with the DP2 primer pair (light green arrows) identifying all four circBART forms, or with the DP1 primer pair (dark green arrows) identifying only the two BSJs representing paired circBARTs. Convergent primers (black arrows) were used to measure viral LMP2 and cellular GAPDH mRNA transcripts.

RNase R-treated (+) or RNase R-untreated (−) RNAs from 6 EBV-positive and 11 EBV-negative (red font) pathologically diagnosed PTLD, NPC tumor xenoexplants C17 and C15, and an EBV-positive AIDS-associated lymphoma were tested by DP1 RT-PCR for circBART-BSJ1 and circBART-BSJ2 (Top). All six EBV-positive PTLDs were strongly positive, and three of the EBV-negative PTLDs were weakly positive for circBART RNAs. RT-PCR for LMP2 (Middle) and GAPDH (Bottom) mRNAs are shown. RNase R treatment enriched circBART junctions and depleted linear LMP2 and GAPDH products. (B) Confirmation of cyclization for EBV circBARTs by RNase H treatment. In vitro RNase H assays using annealed ASOs targeting BSJ1 and BSJ2 showed depletion of junctional sequences after RNase H treatment as monitored by DP1 PCR for Akata, sLCL, and Raji cell RNAs, but not in B95-8 RNA. GAPDH mRNA amplification was not affected by RNase H treatment. (C) RPAD analysis of EBV circBART.

(A) Identification of KSHV RNase R-resistant RNAs. Comparison of deposited BCBL1 poly(A)+ RNA sequences (SRX2323239, BCBL1polyA+seq) and RNase R-treated RNAs from BCBL1 cells with and without NaB/TPA revealed KSHV RNase R-resistant RNAs with potential BSJs from KSHV circRNAs. Two expanded views (Bottom), spanning the PAN/K7.3 and the vIRF4 regions, have BSJs identified by CIRI2 alignment to the deposited BCBL1 HQ404500 genome (Table 2). For circvIRF4 (nucleotides 85,600 to 88,400), backsplicing from a cryptic donor site in exon 2 to a cryptic acceptor site in exon 1 (red arrow) generates a single 632-bp RNA plasmid. Predicted MaxEnt splice sites with entropy scores are shown, as in Fig. 1A. For circPAN/K7.3 (nucleotides 28,200 to 29,300), multiple cyclized RNAs from both sense and antisense orientations were identified by BSJ analysis (Table 2). Shown here are predicted circRNA sequences in K7.3 sense (green arrows) and PAN sense (dark blue arrows) orientations from untreated BCBL1 cells. A divergent PCR primer pair (DP5) was designed to detect the most common circRNAs from this locus. (B) The circvIRF4 and circPAN/K7.3 are detected in KSHV-positive PELs. RNAs were extracted from DMSO or NaB/TPA-treated KSHV-positive BC1, BCBL1, and BCP1 and KSHV-negative BJAB cell lines and tested with DP3 and DP5 divergent primer RT-PCR (see A for primer location). Nuclease-resistant circvIRF4 was present in all untreated KSHV-positive cell lines but markedly diminished after NaB/TPA induction. In contrast, circPAN/K7.3 products were detected from all KSHV-positive cell lines and markedly increased after NaB/TPA treatment. The circPAN/K7.3 banding patterns varied between cell lines and with virus induction. Viral interleukin-6 (vIL6) and cellular GAPDH mRNA RT-PCR amplification is shown for comparison. (C) KSHV circRNAs in KS patient tissues. LANA mRNAs were detected in six out of seven KS tissues. The circvIRF4 BSJ was found in three KS samples (KS4, KS6, and KS8) which also showed higher levels of LANA mRNA. Various RNase R-resistant circPAN/K7.3 isoforms (∼250 bp to 700 bp) were detected in KS4, KS6, and KS9. BJAB and BC-1 RNAs were used as virus negative and positive controls, respectively. (D) Confirmation of cyclization for circvIRF4. In vitro RNase H assays (Left) using annealed ASO showed depletion of the circvIRF4 junctional sequences after RNase H treatment for BC1 and BCBL RNAs, but not in KSHV-negative BJAB RNAs. RPAD analysis (Right) revealed that ribosomal 18S RNA is selectively diminished compared with circvIRF4 RNA. Data represent the mean ± SD from three replicates.",pnas.1811728115fig03

The vertical axis represents the number of reads aligned to each nucleotide position of the KSHV reference genome (autoscaled for the height of reads mapping to the 5’exon downstream of promoter P3(LTd), described in the text; the visible axis range is shown on the left). The total number of reads mapping to the KSHV genome is indicated at the right. The number and position of split reads detected by TopHat2 indicating donor and acceptor sites for spliced transcripts are shown and the corresponding excised intron region is labeled. The positions of poly-A sites of transcript termination are shown: ORF69 (bp 117,509); T0.7 and related Group A transcripts (bp 117,553); ORF71 and related Group B transcripts (bp 122,342); ORF72 monocistronic Group C transcript (bp 123,015), as described in the text.

The proposed non-coding antisense ALT RNA and the positions of the direct repeats DR5, 6 and 7, the long inverted indirect repeat (LIR2) and the microRNA region (miRs) are indicated. The positions of the promoters for the latency transcripts are shown: P1 (LTc; bp 128,089), P2 (LTi; bp 127,789), P3 (LTd; bp 124,131), P4 (~bp 119,035), and P5 (~bp 118,234) promoters and the known latency transcripts are graphically represented. Coding sequences are boxed, adjacent 5’ and 3’ regions are thick lines and introns (a-f) are indicated as thin dotted lines (intron a: bp 123,842…119,048; intron b: bp 127,961…124025; intron c: bp 127,961…119,048; intron d: bp 123,842…123,108; intron e: bp 127,961…127,463; intron f: bp 127,961…127,619). The transcripts terminating at the poly-A site downstream of the Kaposin coding sequence (panel A; bp 117553) are grouped together (Group A), while those terminating at the poly-A site downstream of ORF71 (panel A; bp 122342) are grouped together (Group B). The monocistronic ORF72 Group C transcript terminates at the poly-A site bp 123,015. The major T1.7A spliced transcript in Group A encoding the K12 A/B/C complex is indicated with a double asterisk, while the major T1.7B bicistronic transcript in Group B encoding ORF71/72 is shown with a single asterisk. The first exon (P3-Exon1) in the transcripts derived from promoter P3(LTd) is indicated. The sizes of the transcripts are derived from the GK18 strain (NC_009333 reference sequence) (see S2 Table). The DR5, DR6 and DR7 repeat regions contain different numbers of repeats in different KSHV strains, yielding variation in lengths of the Group A and B transcripts [44]. C) The non-overlapping UCDS features for quantitating transcripts are shown. UCDS features for ORFs 69, 71, 72 and K14 correspond to the coding sequences for these ORFs. The K12A UCDS feature corresponds to the T0.7 transcript, while the K12Aa UCDS feature corresponds to the P3-Exon1 downstream of the P3 (LTd) promoter (bp 124,054‥123,843). The miR UCDS feature identifies reads from unspliced mRNAs, such as the 6.4Kb transcript, which map to the genomic region containing the right long inverted repeat (LIR2) encoding the microRNAs K1-9. The miR UCDS feature does not detect processed miRNAs, as these RNAs are not polyadenylated and thus are not present in the sequenced RNA-seq library. The ORF73a and ORF73b UCDS features target the non-repetitive regions of the ORF73 transcript, and reads are combined for quantitation. The DR6 UCDS feature targets an extremely GC-rich repetitive region. D) mRNA reads mapping to the latency region extending from the flanking ORF69 to the terminal K15 were quantitated for 34 KS tumors using the UCDS features and normalized (TPM), and the median and interquartile range was plotted using an R-based BoxPlot algorithm, see Materials and methods. The reads mapping to the K12Aa, DR6, DR5 and K12A UCDS features are boxed in red to indicate their relationship within the T1.7A spliced transcript, while the reads mapping to the ORF71/ORF72 and ORF75/K15 are boxed in blue and purple, respectively, to indicate their relationship within bicistronic transcripts T1.7B (single asterisk, Panel B) and T6.3, respectively.",ppat.1007441.g005

EBV and KSHV primarily infect B cells within the hematopoietic lineage. EBV transforms these cells into potent antigen-presenting cells that are at least involved in the expansion of virus-specific T cells but might also prime these (dashed arrow). These expanded T cells then block the outgrowth of virus-transformed B cells into lymphomas. Dendritic cells receive virus antigens either via antigen transfer from infected cells or therapeutically via antibody plus antigen hybrid molecules as well as recombinant viruses, e.g., adenovirus (rAdV), for priming and expansion of virus-specific T cells.

Following infection of a spindle cell precursor, KSHV establishes a latent infection. In addition to constitutively expressed latent genes, transient expression of lytic genes during the establishment phase or lytic gene expression that may result from partial de-repression of the viral genome may contribute to epigenetic alteration of host chromatin. Additionally, paracrine signals (e.g., via vIL-6 secretion) received from lytically infected cells may contribute to epigenome alterations. Over time, accumulation of such changes may contribute to tumorigenesis. Additionally, these changes may ensure survival of spindle cells that have lost KSHV until they become re-infected by reactivated cells. b Evolution of the viral epigenetic landscape after de novo KSHV infection (adopted from [94], with permission). The heatmap shows accumulation of activating and repressive (H3K4-me3 and H3K27-me3, respectively) histone marks along the KSHV genome at 24-, 48-, and 72-h post-infection. Arrows underneath the map of the KSHV long unique region (LUR) symbolize transcripts encoding constitutive latency genes or the lytic transactivator ORF50/Rta.

GHVs infect naïve and extrafollicular B cells. Infected B cells enter the germinal center with a BCR repertoire that is distinct from the uninfected GC B cells. Infected B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination, while undergoing proliferative expansion and likely evading typical selective pressures. In addition, B cells infected with KSHV and MHV68 undergo receptor editing. GHVs exit the GC as an isotype class-switched B cell or a PC. Direct infection of post-GC memory B cells is a potential route to the class-switched memory compartment. Plasma cell differentiation drives GHV reactivation.

Etoposide binds and inhibits topoisomerase II, which results in formation of DSB and activates DDR. ATM senses DSB and autophosphorylates. Because SSB are being introduced during DSB repair, etoposide also activates ATR kinase. Both kinases phosphorylate p53 and HDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which breaks their interactions and leads to p53 accumulation and stabilization and results in expression of p53 target genes. Nultin-3 inhibits HDM2:p53 interactions and thereby induces p53 accumulation. The response is measured using Luc-reporter assay and immunoblotting with Abs specific for ATM pSer1981, ATR pThr1989, p53 pSer15, p53 and p21. (B) Relative expression levels of p53-dependent luciferase reporter. Shown is the mean effect size plus 95%CI after adjustment for multiple comparisons to control using Dunnett’s methods.

HIV-1 infected cells express and release gp120, Tat, Nef, p17, RT, each capable of the induction of oxidative stress. (1) p17 may trigger the production of ROS through binding of redox active metal ions by its amyloidogenic assemblies [167]. (2) Nef may indirectly activate NADPH oxidase by activating the Vav/Rac/p21-activated kinase (PAK) signaling pathway involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase activation and produce peroxynitrite [160]. (3) Tat induces oxidative action through several independent mechanisms via NADPH oxidase, spermine oxidase (SMO) induction and mitochondrial dysfunction [148]. (4) RT induces ROS through unknown mechanisms. There is ROS –dependent activation of the Twist [134], which regulates the expression of Nrf2, which stimulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes (HO1, Nqol1). In addition, the Twist regulates the expression of the Snail. Both transcription factors, Twist and Snail, are involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transduction (EMT). (5) Gp120 increases free radical production from monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) inducing nitrogen oxide (NO). In astrocytes (AS), it enhances ROS production by several parallel mechanisms: via cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), NOX2 and NOX4, and the Fenton-Weiss-Haber reaction. Multidrug resistance proteins (Mrps) involved in cellular defense against oxidative stress. Mrp4 (isoform of Mrp) involved in the regulation of ROS and it acts against ROS [156].

This leads to enhanced lymphomagenesis and the resulting tumors have characteristics of primary effusion lymphomas (PELs). (B) EBV infection of B cells up-regulates CD4 and with the sustained expression of CXCR4 renders EBV transformed B cells susceptible to infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Conditioning of the tumor microenvironment by lytic EBV and KSHV gene products occurs most likely at the same time in primary effusion lymphomas (PELs) that are 100% KSHV and 90% EBV infected. Lytic EBV replication attracts monocytes via CCL5 to become immune suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Viral IL-10 (vIL-10; BCRF1) suppresses CD8+ T cell recognition. In addition, the lytic KSHV product viral G-protein coupled receptor (vGPCR; ORF74) promotes angiogenesis. Furthermore, K1 (ORF-K1) and viral protein kinase (vPK; ORF36) promote proliferation of KSHV infected cells. Finally, viral IL-6 (vIL-6; ORF-K2) promotes KSHV infected B cell proliferation.

Autophagosomes form upon nutrient depletion, whereby AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activates, and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibits the protein kinase ULK1. ULK1 then phosphorylates the PI3 kinase complex containing VPS34 and Beclin-1 (stage 1). This complex phosphorylates PI3 (stage 2). The resulting PI3P recruits the E3-like LC3B ligase complex of Atg5, Atg12 and Atg16L1, which couples LC3B-I to phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3B-II) in the isolation membrane that often originates from the endoplasmic reticulum (stage 3). LC3B-I is formed by pro-LC3B being cleaved by Atg4, then activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7 and conjugated by the E2-like enzyme Atg3. LC3B-II is involved in the elongation of the isolation membrane until completion of the double-membrane-surrounded autophagosome, as well as substrate recruitment, exemplified by viral capsid recruitment with the macroautophagy receptor p62. Upon completion, LC3B is recycled from the outer autophagosomal membrane by the protease Atg4. The completed autophagosome then fuses with late endosomes or lysosomes for degradation of its content and the inner autophagosomal membrane (stage 4). Rab7, syntaxin 17 (STX17) and YKT6 participate in this fusion to generate the autolysosome. Rubicon inhibits this autophagosome maturation. EBV stimulates macroautophagy via LMP1 which then regulates its cellular levels by degradation via macroautophagy. Furthermore, BHRF1 and BPLF1 inhibit selective macroautophagy via p62. EBV then utilizes LC3B-coupled membranes for its envelope for efficient egress and LC3B-II can be found in purified EBV particles. KSHV blocks macroautophagy by inhibiting Beclin-1 with its viral Bcl-2 homolog (vBcl-2). Furthermore, it blocks Atg3 with its viral FLIP protein (vFLIP). Finally, K7 inhibits autophagosome maturation by binding to Rubicon.",viruses-13-00859-g001

EBV compromises antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells via MHC class I molecules by blocking their peptide loading through inhibition of the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This TAP inhibition is performed by the BNLF2a protein and by downregulation of TAP2 by BHRF1 miRNAs. Furthermore, BILF1 causes MHC class I complexes with peptides to be internalized from the cell membrane for lysosomal degradation. Moreover, EBV blocks antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells by its MHC class II-binding protein gp42. Furthermore, its BART miRNAs block expression of components of lysosomal antigen processing for MHC class II presentation, such as γ-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) and the cysteine protease legumain (LGMN). The BART cluster also contains a miRNA that downregulates MICB, one of the ligands for the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D which is important for both NK and CD8+ T cell recognition of EBV-infected B cells. KSHV encodes the two ubiquitin ligases K3 and K5 which cause internalization for lysosomal degradation of MHC class I and II peptide complexes from the cell membrane. K5 can also internalize the NKG2D ligands MICA and MICB. Furthermore, vIRF3 of KSHV inhibits MHC class II expression, and KSHV miRNAs downregulate MICB.",viruses-13-00859-g002

The graph summarizes genetic mutations that predispose for EBV-associated diseases: MAGT1 and ITK can both mediate the T cell activation by regulating PLCγ1. This pathway is further regulated by RASGRP1, which is the main activator for the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway for T and NK cell activation. In addition, MAGT1 also interacts with NKG2D to regulate the cytotoxic effector function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. By engaging the receptors for 2B4 and NTB-A, they facilitate the NFκB signaling pathway through the interaction with the SAP adaptor protein. Similar for CD27, the engagement of CD70 leads to the activation of NF-κB and c-Fos/c-Jun pathways.

(A) Holoendemic Pf infection is associated with the development of EBV-positive endemic BL. Pf is thought to drive EBV-infected B cells more frequently into the germinal center reaction where translocation of the oncogene c-myc into the heavy or light immunoglobulin chain (IgH or IgL) locus occurs that is characteristic for BL and responsible for its proliferation. In addition, Pf attenuates EBV-specific T cell-mediated immune control, thereby increasing the number of EBV-infected B cells. (B) HIV infection compromises EBV-specific immune control, but at the same time can also infect EBV-positive B cells that then are better controlled by CD8+ T cells due to an upregulation of MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation. (C) KSHV co-infection drives increased EBV-associated lymphomagenesis by transactivating lytic EBV replication in double infected B cells.

PLCγ1 is depicted in its closed, enzymatically inactive conformation, in which the cSH2 domain is positioned in the proximity of the catalytic core (X/Y). The model is based on findings reported in references [43,44,45,46,66]. Below Left: Activation of PLCγ1 by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK): following autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues, the cytoplasmic RTK domain recruits the PLCγ1 nSH2 domain and phosphorylates PLCγ1 Y783, which in turn binds into the cSH2 domain, thus removing it from its proximity to the catalytic core, and thereby activates the enzymatic activity of the latter. Below Right: Activation of PLCγ1 by pK15: as shown in this report, the phosphorylated Y481 of pK15 (phosphorylated by Src in our experiments) binds into the PLCγ1 cSH2 domain. This presumably leads to a conformational change in PLCγ1, which in turn facilitates the subsequent phosphorylation of PLCγ1 Y783 by members of the Src kinase family and subsequent activation of PLCγ1 lipase activity.",ppat.1009635.g008

Ubiquitination of Lys420 inhibits the formation of SQSTM1/p62 homodimers by preventing electrostatic interaction with the Glu409 residue on adjacent SQSTM1/p62 molecules. This promotes an open conformation that allows the recruitment of ubiquitinated cargo to the UBA domain. The deubiquitinating enzymes encoded in the N-terminus of HSV-1-UL36, HCMV-UL48, EBV-BPLF1 and KSHV-ORF64 bind to and deubiquitinate SQSTM1/p62. UL48, BPLF1 and ORF64 remove both Lys48 and Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains locking SQSTM1/p62 in heterodimers that cannot bind ubiquitinated cargo, which results in failure to recruit the autophagic machinery and inhibits autophagy. In UL36 expressing cells, the persistence of Lys63-linked chains is sufficient to prevent the formation of heterodimers and activates SQSTM1/p62-dependent autophagy. In addition, intramolecular blockade of the UBA by Lys63-linked chains may redirect SQSTM1/p62 to other functions.",BCJ-478-2297-g0005

Similarly, COVID-19 targets were obtained through the GeneCards and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) databases. Intersecting targets were then assessed by molecular docking and GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment analysis was carried out with the OmicShare tools. The KOBAS 3.0 database was used for KEGG enrichment analysis, and RStudio was used to visualize the results. Molecular docking was conducted by an open-source program named Autodock vina 1.1.2.

In addition to direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, CDK4/6 inhibitors downregulate DNA methyltransferase 1, which activates both ERVs and certain KSHV/EBV genes. The DNA and RNA viral elements stimulate IFNs, which activate transcription factors including STAT1 and NLRC5. These genes in turn transactivate the expression of ISGs and immune surface molecules including MHC-I, ICAM-1, B7-2, and PD-L1.

(a). PDT: Excitation of the photosensitizers (PS) by different light sources (NIR laser, blue light, or incandescent light) produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) via two types of processes depending on the PS, the hydroxyl radicals (HO−) via type I and singlet oxygen radicals (1O2) via type II. The singlet oxygen (1O2) is the main cytotoxic agent involved in PDT. (b). PTT: Thermal phototherapy relies on the ability of organic or inorganic photothermal agents (PTA) to enter an excited state when subjected to a laser in the near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The excited PTA will release vibrational energy which leads to a rise in temperature. (c). PAT: The synchronization of laser pulses and ultrasound bursts could cause a shear stress (Ƭ) in the microvessels. The shear stress is a mechanical force resulting from tangential force (F) acting on a surface, and it can directly affect the physiological function of cells in targeted tissue.",pharmaceuticals-15-00858-g001

The kinase mutated in the ATP binding pocket (As-RSK) can use regular ATP as well as a bulkier ATP analog (A*TP-S). Use of the ATP analog induces the thiophosphorylation of the substrate. After an alkylation reaction with paranitrobenzylmesylate (PNBM), thiophosphates are converted to thiophosphate esters, which are specifically recognized by an anti-thiophosphate ester antibody. All other wild-type kinases in the cell have normal ATP binding pockets that cannot accommodate the ATP analog. (B) Identification of the gatekeeper residue in RSK2. The gatekeeper residue of RSK2 was identified by aligning the sequences of c-SRC (P00523) with those of the N-terminal kinase domain of RSKs (RSK1: Q15418, RSK2: P51812, RSK3: Q15349, RSK4: Q9UK32). Typically, the gatekeeper residue aligns with T338 of c-SRC and is preceded by two hydrophobic amino acids and followed by an acidic and another hydrophobic amino acid. RSK2 gatekeeper residue was thereby identified as L147. (C-E) HeLa cells expressing As2-RSK or WT-RSK were infected with TMEV for 8h (MOI 5) (C and E) or with EMCV for 3h30min (MOI 5) (D).

Human oncoviruses infect the cells by establishing persistent infections that reprogram the host metabolism, subverting through the immune escaping the antiviral defense of the cell. When the virus can replicate massively, it can infect new hosts. An oncovirus free of replicating inside the cell actives the expression of viral oncoproteins or the transcription of host genes that mediate the cell survival through increased proliferation and reduced cell death. With the increased rate of cell cycles, the likelihood of events that cause genomic instability is also increased. Genomic instability is also promoted by the inflammation deriving from the escape of the immune system and external co-carcinogenic factors (red box). The inflammatory response to oncovirus infection generates ROS that augments the genomic instability, also through the potentiation of cell proliferation to replace damaged tissues. The combination of all these factors (purple boxes) can contribute to the transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell.",ijms-24-07803-g001
