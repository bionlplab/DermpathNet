The tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT1 forms homodimers that translocate to the nucleus and bind GAS (IFN-γ-activated site) elements, which are present in the promoters of IFN-γ-regulated genes. The IFN-γ-activated JAKs also regulate, through as-yet-unknown intermediates, activation of the catalytic subunit (p110) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).

TGF-β increases the expression of miR-21 which suppresses the expression of TGF-βRII, resulting in reduced TGF-β receptor-mediated signaling. Regression of TGF-βRII by miR-21 either directly or indirectly alters TGF-β-induced miR-21 through a feedback mechanism, leading to differential expression of PTEN, E2F1 and PDCD4 and other miR-21 target genes. As such, altered expression of miR-21, TGF-β, TGF-βRII, PTEN, E2F1 and PDCD4 could then alter the balance between the rate of cell growth and apoptosis, inflammatory reaction and extracellular matrix accumulation, resulting in leiomyoma growth and regression, or mediate myometrial and leiomyoma cellular transformation. Using Ingenuity pathway analysis provided a functional network among TGF-βRII-, PTEN-, E2F1- and PDCD4-mediated actions, which include interactions with other gene products and signaling pathways (i.e. Smad, AKT, JUK, NFkβ, cbp/p300, VEGF, 14-3-3 and proteasome) that regulate the above cellular processes.",gap09308,NotMatch,NotMatch

            among cells expressing wild-type and JAK1 mutants. (b) Defective DNA-binding activities
            of IRF-1 and STAT1 suggest that LMP2 expression is attributable to mutations in the
            catalytic domains of JAK1. DNA-binding activities of SP1 were detected in all tested
            samples. RT-PCR supported W.B. results. The experiments were performed three times with

PMC4632006,Figure 1,"Left: the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is mainly activated by nutrients (not shown) and growth factors, binding to receptor tyrosine kinases and activating PI3K. As PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) is converted to PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 1) phosphorylates AKT1 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1) upon PIP3-mediated recruitment to the plasma membrane. AKT1 inhibits TSC1/2 (tuberous sclerosis 1/2), relieving the inhibition of Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), which activates mTOR. The recruitment of Raptor (regulatory associated protein of MTOR, complex 1), Deptor (DEP domain containing MTOR-interacting protein), and GβL (mLST8; G protein beta subunit-like MTOR associated protein, LST8 homolog) gives rise to the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Upon activation of S6K1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1) and inhibition of 4EBP-1 (EIF4EBP1; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1), protein translation is stimulated by activation of ribosomal protein S6 and eIF4B and E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B and E). Additionally, AKT1 activates β-catenin signaling. Middle: BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling is modulated through binding of BMPs to BMPR1 and BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type I/II) and the coreceptor endoglin, activating Smad1/5/8 and leading to transcription of target genes involved in angiogenesis and proliferation. Endoglin may also activate PI3K/AKT signaling. Right: canonical Wnt signaling is activated by binding of Wnt to the Frizzled receptor and the LRP (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) coreceptor. Upon recruitment of Dsh (dishevelled) and Axin to the plasma membrane, the β-catenin destruction complex, which contains Axin, APC (adenomatosis polyposis coli), GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), and CKI (casein kinase 1), is inactivated, leading to β-catenin accumulation and transcription of target genes after association with TCF/LEF (transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor). Noncanonical signaling plays a role in cell migration, invasion, and cytoskeleton arrangement and is mediated through binding of Wnt to Frizzled and other coreceptors such as ROR2 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2) or without coreceptors.",SARCOMA2015-243298.001,NotMatch,NotMatch

PMC5880257,Figure 2.,"Identification of somatic and germline variants in genes from the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway from Cases 1–8. Graphical representation of the variants identified by WGS in 22 DDR pathway genes in cancer Cases 1–8. A and B show somatic and germline variants, respectively, for each cancer case. Each bar or track on the horizontal axis represents a different cancer case and the 22 individual DDR genes are represented on the vertical axis. CNAs, indels, and SNVs are represented by circles, squares, and diamonds, respectively. The color key indicates more detail about the type of variant (e.g., a red circle represents a homozygous copy-number loss). Only disruptive somatic or germline SNVs and indels are included, whereas for germline variants (B) only SNVs with minor allele frequency of <6% are included. Case 1 includes a somatic missense SNV and a cnLOH region involving TP53, as well as copy-number loss of PTEN and allelic imbalance of BRCA2. Case 2 presents copy-number aberrations overlapping various DDR genes, but no SNVs, indels, or copy-number events involving TP53. Case 3 includes TP53 mutations, an allelic imbalance involving TP53, BRCA1, BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D, and a single loss involving FANCA. In Case 4, WGS detected a germline deleterious SNV in RAD51B, together with a somatic CN loss in the same locus. Case 5 includes somatic mutations in various DDR genes but no copy-number aberrations, whereas RAD54L and ATM in the germline are affected by a region of homozygosity and a missense mutation, respectively. Case 6 has a frameshift mutation and a CN loss involving TP53 and, importantly, a somatic homozygous CN loss encompassing BRCA2. In Case 7, most DDR genes are affected by a somatic CN loss or gain, whereas the germline includes missense mutations in FANCI, RAD54L, RAD51B, and PARP1. Finally, in Case 8, PTEN and BRCA2 are affected by somatic CN losses, and ATM includes a splice site mutation in the germline. See the main text for more details.",MCS002279Sch_F2,NotMatch,NotMatch

A common characteristic of WDLS, DDLS, and PLS is amplifications in HMGA2, MDM2, and CDK4. PLS bears additional CCND1 amplifications. MLS, on the other hand, harbors a fusion of TLS/FUS–CHOP, which is responsible for pathogenesis. Angiosarcomas are diverse malignancies and bear aberrations in MYC, VEGF/VEGFR, PTPRB, and PLCG1. Leiomyosarcomas have frequent X-chromosome (Chr) gains, constitutively activated Akt and losses in Chr 10, which bears the PTEN gene. The two latter aberrations lead to mTOR activation via TSC2 and are instrumental in disease pathology. Rhabdomyosarcoma can be subtyped into alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) and embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). The former is associated with PAX3/7–FOXO1 fusions and cause Hippo-pathway dysregulation accompanied by bypass of cellular senescence, and the latter is distinguished by losses in Chr 11, along with gene mutations in the Ras pathway. Other pathways involved include Hedgehog, PI3K, and p53.

The downregulation of RORα and RORβ induce antitumor effect in hepatoma, breast cancer (BC), melanoma, and colon cancer. The upregulation of RORγ in ILC3 leads to protumor effect by chemokines in BC. The downregulation of RORγ in Th17 indicates antitumor effect by IL-17 in colon cancer. The upregulation of RORγ in Treg shows protumor effect in colon cancer. The expression of RORγ in myeloid cell has protumor effects via Socs3, Bcl3, and C/EBPb. The expression of RORγ in tumor cell is either increased or decreased depending on the cancer type.

PMC6691157,Figure 2,"A diagram of EBV-B cell and EBV-epithelial cell interactions thought to occur during primary and persistent EBV infection in the immunocompetent host. Orally acquired virus particles infect both resting B cells and oral epithelium. Current evidence suggests that oropharyngeal B cells may be the initial target, leading to local foci of EBV-transformed B cell growth (via a Latency III- type infection) in oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues; mucosal epithelial cells may then acquire infectious virus either by direct transfer from virus bound to the resting B cell surface or from a small fraction of transformed B cells switching into lytic cycle. Some other virus-transformed B cells are able to down-regulate viral antigen expression, stop proliferating and enter the recirculating memory B cell pool. How this occurs is unclear. One possible route is via a physiologic germinal center (GC) reaction, another via a non-GC route; in either case, this transition may involve progressively more restricted forms of Latency (II and/or I) before entry into Latency 0. Occasional reactivation of latently-infected memory B cells into lytic cycle, possibly induced by triggers of plasma cell differentiation, produces virions that through close cell-cell contact can initiate new latent B cell infections or establish new foci of virus replication in epithelial cells. Although not shown on the diagram, the above events are subject to immune controls; for a description of immune responses to latent and lytic infections, see Taylor et al.

PMC6691157,Figure 3,"Diagrammatic representation of the germinal center (GC) reaction, showing the physiologic events involved in affinity maturation of antibody responses. Initially antigen-stimulated naïve B cells are induced into clonal expansion as centroblasts (CB), undergoing somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes and producing a centrocyte (CC) population encompassing a range of variant sequences. This is an iterative process and may involve cells undergoing several rounds of CC/CB transition. Most centrocytes then die by apoptosis. Only those expressing immunoglobulin with increased affinity for the original antigen are able to escape by capturing antigen from the surface of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and attracting antigen-specific T cell help. Following class switch recombination (CSR) to generate different immunoglobulin isotypes, these centrocytes differentiate either into memory B cells or plasmablasts/plasma cells and leave the GC. Note that, although not shown on the diagram, memory cells in the recirculating pool may be recruited back into a germinal center reaction or directly driven to become plasma cells following re-exposure to antigen. EBV-associated B-LPD and B cell lymphomas display genotypic and/or phenotypic markers that indicate their origin from precursors at one or other position on this B cell differentiation pathway; here we show the presumed identity of those precursors for B-LPD, BL, HL, the various DLBCLs, PBL, and PEL.",fonc-09-00713-g0003,NotMatch,NotMatch

A, Data from mouse studies were compared with the pharmacokinetic parameters and dose in humans.

These predicted Cmax and AUClast values for a dose of 12.5 mg/kg were set as Cmax and AUClast-driven targets in the human. In the mouse, 99.5% of the PTC596 is protein bound, so free Cmax (fCmax) and free AUClast (fAUClast) values for a dose of 12.5 mg/kg were predicted as values measured at 10 mg/kg × 0.005 × 1.25. The predicted fCmax and fAUClast values for a dose of 12.5 mg/kg were adjusted for reduced protein binding in humans (99.2%) and defined as fCmax and fAUClast targets in the human. The predicted human dose for each pharmacokinetic parameter was determined from regression analysis using the human pharmacokinetic dataset from the phase I trial. B, The pharmacokinetic parameters AUClast and Cmax were determined in plasma samples collected from the enrolled patients with cancer on day 1, cycle 1.

While subtype 1 is a mix of all sites (extremity, abdominal and gynecological), subtype 2 is largely abdominal, with some extremity tumors. Subtype 2 can be further sub-stratified into subtype 2a and 2b. The metastatic lesions in subtype 2 cluster with their matched primary tumors. There are two metastatic tumors in subtype 1 that are from the same patient. Lastly, subtype 3 represents a largely gynecological (uterine, vaginal, fallopian tube) subtype. b Genomic point mutation, indel (insertion/deletion), and structural variant (SV) burdens are lower in subtype 2 than subtypes 1 or 3. Horizontal black lines represent the median values for each subtype. Source data are provided in Supplementary Data 7. c LMS molecular subtypes are of distinct smooth muscle lineages: vertices of the triangular plot represent smooth muscle of vasculature, digestive tissue, and gynecological tissue.

The primary tumor at diagnosis (Dx) was located in the small intestine, while the first metastatic relapse (MR1) was located in the liver. The second metastatic relapse (MR2) was multifocal and detected in the vastus lateralis (thigh muscle). MR2 was bisected and biopsies were taken from five distinct sections from both foci (Regions/Re 1–5). Following bulk (Dx, MR1) and multiregion (MR2) sequencing, phylogenetic reconstruction can be seen on the right.

PMC8929133,Figure 5,"The invasion and metastatic process of uterine mesenchymal tumor stem-like cells. The nature of malignant tumors varies from patient to patient. Malignant tumor tissue comprises a heterogeneous cell population, containing many fibroblasts and tumor stem cells in addition to tumor cells. The heterogeneity of malignant tumor cells is one of the main reasons for the difficulty in treating malignant tumors. In particular, malignant tumor stem cells undergo distant metastasis and have resistance to antitumor agents. Understanding the oncological properties of malignant tumor stem cells contributes to the development of new targeted antitumor agents. The complex process of distant metastasis includes detachment, invasion of the tumor microenvironment, and shedding of invasive tumor cells (ITCs) and CD44-positive invasive tumor stem cells (ITSCs) into the bloodstream (intravasation). The majority of ITCs relate to differentiated cancer cells with low tumorigenicity and instead undergo apoptosis. However, CD44-positive ITSCs bear cancer stem cell features, i.e., CD44-positive circulating tumor stem cells (CTSC), survive in the circulating blood, escape from immune surveillance, and go home to secondary sites, extravasate, and ultimately form distant metastatic lesions. The application of cytotoxic drugs for ITSCs and/or CTSCs, such as celecoxib, greatly reduces the incidence of tumor metastases and tumor recurrence [35].

PMC8997253,Figure 1.,"Interplay between the tumor cell of origin, genetic alterations, and transcriptional programs dictates sarcoma identity. A multipotent progenitor (i) in the branchial arches, structures that give rise to head and neck cells, of mice expresses aP2/Fabp4 (Adipose protein 2/Fatty acid binding protein 4) (II) by day E10.5 of embryogenesis. In our model, this endothelial progenitor population (III) will express aP2-Cre, and it can then go on to develop into mature endothelial cells (IV) under wild-type conditions. However, following oncogenic insult with concomitant KrasG12D (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) activation and Cdkn2a (Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2a) loss in these aP2-Cre-expressing endothelial progenitors or mature endothelial cells (v), these cells will ultimately initiate angiosarcoma formation, a deadly vascular sarcoma.6 Activation of the sonic hedgehog pathway by transgenic conditional SmoM2 (SmoothenedM2) (VI) expression in the E14.5 endothelial progenitor population in aP2-Cre;SmoM2 mice results in a well-differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) expressing skeletal myogenic transcription factors MYOD1 (MYOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION 1) and MYOG (MYOGENIN) (VII). However, when Pten (Phosphatase and tensin homolog) is conditionally deleted (PtencKO) in the aP2-Cre;SmoM2 tumors, a more malignant RMS develops with increased proliferative index, decreased skeletal myogenic differentiation, and increased expression of the satellite cell marker Pax7 (Paired box 7) (VIII). With concomitant deletion of Pten and Pax7 (PtencKO and Pax7cKO) in the aP2-Cre;SmoM2 tumors, we no longer see RMS but a switch to a smooth muscle differentiated tumor such as leiomyosarcoma expressing smooth muscle-related genes (Acta2, Actin alpha 2, smooth muscle; Myh11, Myosin heavy chain 11; Myocd, Myocardin) and not skeletal myogenic genes (Myod1 and Myog) (IX).7",KMCO_A_2002120_F0001_OC,Match,NotMatch

PMC9180633,Figure 1,"Schematic representation of the Notch signaling pathway. Notch signaling is activated when a NOTCH ligand binds to a NOTCH receptor on an adjacent cell. This triggers ADAM10/17 to perform an S2 cleavage of the NOTCH receptor. γ-secretase then catalyzes an S3 cleavage of the receptor, which releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the cell membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex with DNA-binding transcription factors such as Recombination Signal Binding Protein for Immunoglobulin Kappa J Region (RBPJ) and Mastermind Like (MAML), resulting in transcription of downstream effectors such as HES1. When cells are exposed to γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), such as DAPT or MK-0752, S3 cleavage of the NOTCH receptor does not occur, preventing release of the NICD.

After neoadjuvant radiotherapy, the tumor was resected. Routine follow-up according to ESMO guidelines was conducted. In the second year after removal of the primary tumor, lung metastases and a local recurrence were detected. As there was progressive disease with chemotherapy (CTX), several lung metastases and the recurrence were resected. An individual mini-panel covering seven mutations identified by exome sequencing was established to quantify ctDNA in 13 plasma samples.

As lncRNAs work as decoys for miRNAs, oncogene mRNA translation is allowed, starting the LMS and ESS carcinogenesis. Created with BioRender.com.",biomedicines-10-02567-g005,NotMatch,NotMatch

PMC9696472,Figure 1,"Model illustrating the infection of EBV in human. EBV is usually transmitted through saliva and first comes across oropharynx and tonsils of the new host, where it primarily infects naïve B cells and possibly memory B cells and epithelial cells as well. EBV establishes latent infection in most naïve B cells, while a small fraction of them might enter productive lytic infection. The latently infected naïve B cells are activated and undergo a phase of rapid expansion as a result of EBV latent gene expression. These activated infected B cells then enter the germinal center (GC), transiting to a more restricted form of viral latency. Finally, the infected B cells differentiate into resting memory B cells, where EBV nearly completely stops its gene expression and maintains its lifelong persistence, but the details of this process are still poorly understood. The EBV-infected resting memory B cells recirculate in the peripheral blood. Under certain stimulations, these resting memory B cells can differentiate into plasma cells, reenter a lytic infection state, and produce infectious virions. These virions lack in gp42 and are more epithelium-tropic. After infecting epithelial cells, the virus replicates lyses the cells, releasing the B-cell-tropic virions with high levels of gp42 into the saliva and starting a new round of transmission.

Firstly, EBV gp350 attachment with CD21 or CD35, and tethering EBV to B-cell membranes. Then, gH/gL-gp42 binds to receptor HLA class II. This interaction lets gH/gL-gp42 enable interacting with the prefusion form of gB. The interaction leads to a series of structural changes in gB and ultimately fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane. Extended rearrangements within gB (intermediate) enables insertion of the fusion loops into the B-cell membrane and the refolding of gB forms post-fusion gB, which mediates the merging of the two membranes. (B) The entry of EBV via direct fusion with epithelial cell membranes. Firstly, gp350/220 interacts with CD21 and/or BMRF2/gH/gL, with integrins tethering EBV to the epithelial cell membrane. After this, gH/gL binds to EphA2/NMHC-IIA or gB interacts with NRP1, producing a membrane fusion signal. The signal is passed to gB and causes a series of changes in its configuration. Extended rearrangements within gB trigger insertion of the fusion loops into the epithelial cell membrane, followed by the refolding of gB to post-fusion form and mediates the merging of the two bilayers. The structures are shown as cartoons: structures of CD21 (2GSX) [97], EBV gp350 (2H6O) [95], the complex of gH/gL (3PHF) [103], the complex of gp42-HLA-DR1 (1KG0) [101], post-fusion gB (3FVC) [98], and EphA2 (2X10) [104] and modified using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.1.0 Schrödinger, LLC.

In colorectal cancer, progranulin promotes AKT activation in a TNFR2-dependent manner. In prostate cancer, sortilin acts as a negative regulator of progranulin by promoting progranulin internalization and degradation, leading to the inhibition of the AKT pathway. In turn, progranulin mediates sortilin ubiquitination and degradation to sustain its pro-oncogenic activity. In bladder cancer, progranulin binds to and activates EphA2, leading to AKT and MAPK activation. In turn, AKT and MAPK sustain EphA2 phosphorylation at Ser897. In mesothelioma, progranulin-dependent activation of the AKT and MAPK signaling pathways relies on EGFR and RYK. Progranulin directly interacts with TNFRs, sortilin and EphA2.

The mass (encircled by a dotted line) is present between the round ligament (white arrow) and uterine artery and is enclosed by a membrane. The right ovary (white arrow) present superior to the mass is normal. The images suggest that the mass may be a degenerative uterine leiomyoma growing from within the myometrium into the broad ligament. The leiomyoma measures approximately 20 mm in size on the posterior wall of the uterine fundus. No lesions are seen in the ovaries. Significant lymphadenopathy or ascites is absent. (B) Results of histopathological examination. A soft mass approximately 120 mm in size is seen protruding from the uterine serosal surface. The cut surface of the mass is grayish white and multinodular and demonstrates a proliferation of smooth muscle cells having an island-like/alveolar-like morphology with edematous stroma. Marked infiltration of these smooth muscle cells into the uterine smooth muscle layer is observed. There is also evidence of infiltration of some proliferating smooth muscle cells into the blood vessels. No severe nuclear atypia or mitotic cells are observed. On the basis of these findings, a diagnosis of cotyledonoid dissecting leiomyoma can be considered. Surgical pathological examination reveals no malignant findings in cervical and fallopian tube tissues. Upper panel: magnification ×10; lower panel: magnification ×40.

Networks were modeled using PANDA and LIONESS, integrating information on protein-protein interactions (PPI) between transcription factors (TF), prior information on TF-DNA motif binding, and gene expression data.

The variance explained by the first principal component is extracted; 3) The amount of variance explained by PC1 is compared to the expected amount of variance explained, which is obtained by applying PCA on edge weights connected to 1,000 randomly generated gene sets of the same size as the selected pathway.
