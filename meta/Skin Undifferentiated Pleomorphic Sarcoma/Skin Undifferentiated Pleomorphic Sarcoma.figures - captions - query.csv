Tissue samples showed varying FAP expression, which was graded using a semiquantitative FAP expression score ranging from score 0 (no expression), score 1 (low expression), score 2 (intermediate expression) to score 3 (high expression). In cats, all tumors showed at least a low FAP positivity and had a score of 1 or higher, and no score of 0 was given. The images show examples of cytoplasmic (e.g., human score 2 and feline score 3) and membranous (e.g., human score 3 and canine score 3) staining patterns of tumor cells. Scale bar 50 µm.

PMC10505752,Figure 2,"Schematic representation of the strategy for visual and digital image analyses. Anti-fibroblast activation protein alpha and routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained glass slides were scanned in a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0-HT scanner. They were used for quantitative, semiquantitative, and qualitative image analyses. A qualitative visual assessment of FAP-labeled tissue was performed by pathologists, and a semiquantitative FAP expression score was defined for each tumor. For automated quantitative image analysis using artificial intelligence, digitized slides were stored on a centralized server, and a direct link was established with the Visiopharm Integrator System (VIS) version 6.9.0.2779 (Visiopharm, Hørsholm, Denmark) platform. The first step of digital image analysis was the manual delineation of the regions of interest (ROIs). Each color represents one tissue type that was assessed separately. Automated tissue detection for segmentation and exclusion of artifacts (in gray) was performed. Automated visual detection and quantification of FAP labeling resulted in quantitative output measures. The algorithm for the different brown groups was designed so that it uses a pixel intensity thresholding for the level 1 (FAP-positive cells) weak immunoreactivity of 131–175 pixels; level 2, intermediate immunoreactivity (101–130 pixels); level 3, strong immunoreactivity (71–100 pixel); level 4, very strong immunoreactivity (<71 pixels). Pixel values above 176 were considered as background staining intensity (FAP-negative cells). The FAP-labeled areas, the staining intensity levels, and the mean staining intensity were used for statistical comparison. Results of the qualitative and quantitative FAP tumor labeling were used for target selection criteria scoring. FAP, fibroblast activation protein alpha.",fonc-13-1210004-g002,NotMatch,NotMatch

(A) The H&E-stained section, (B) the FAP IHC section, and (C) the corresponding FAP-positive areas after quantification in color. Different colors represent the different labeling intensity levels ranging from level 1 (yellow; weak immunoreactivity) to level 2 (red; intermediate), level 3 (blue; strong), to level 4 (green; very strong immunoreactivity). The FAP-positive tumor cells show a cytoplasmic staining pattern of intermediate staining intensity. Endothelial cells of the artery on the right side of the image show a weak positivity for FAP, while the smooth muscle cells are negative.

(A) Box plot illustrating the FAP-stained area (µm2) per 10 high power fields (2.37 mm2) for the different tissue types—adipose tissue, epidermis/dermis, and muscle tissue—of the peritumoral and control tissue divided by species. FAP-stained areas in the peritumoral tissue of one tissue type are similar between species and similar if compared to the healthy control tissue of the same species (p > 0.2838). FAP-stained areas reach the highest values in the epidermis/dermis in all species with significant differences comparing peritumoral epidermis/dermis to peritumoral adipose tissue in dogs (p = 0.0043), peritumoral epidermis/dermis to peritumoral muscle tissue in dogs and cats (canine p = 0.0001, feline p = 0.0084), and healthy epidermis/dermis to healthy muscle tissue in dogs (dogs p = 0.0198).
