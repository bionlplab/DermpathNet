Activation of the Hedgehog (Hh)-signaling pathway due to deficiency in the Hh receptor Patched1 (Ptch) is the crucial molecular defect that causes the formation of BCCs in human skin. Ptch1 possesses a sterol sensing domain (SSD), which is important for suppression of the activity of Smoothened (Smo), the signal transduction partner of Ptch. A current theory suggests that Ptch regulates Smo by removing oxysterols from Smo. Ptch acts like a sterol pump and removes oxysterols that have been created by 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. Upon binding of a Hh protein or a mutation in the SSD of Ptch the pump is turned off allowing oxysterols to accumulate around Smo. This accumulation of sterols allows Smo to become active via GLI signaling or to remain on the cell membrane for a longer period of time.",de-5-38-g2

For all cancers profiled in the TCGA, normalized enrichment scores for each signature were determined and cancer types ranked by descending order (clockwise) of the sum of squares of all the scores with a penalty. By this measure, cuSCC is most closely related to HNSC, LUSC, basal and HER2+ subtypes of breast cancer (BRCA) and ESCA SCC. (b) Given that HNSC is most closely related to cuSCC by this measure, we show that cuSCC signatures can predict outcome (overall survival) in HNSC with TP53 mutation, used here as a proxy for identifying tumours that do not express high-risk HPV. The cross-species early signatures derived from the linear mixed effects model and the cross-species microRNA functional analysis all predict survival in HNSCC for the top and bottom 25% of outcomes with statistical significance. Multiple hypothesis testing was performed and all of the plots shown are significant with the stated P-values and false discovery rate-adjusted q-values of <0.1 (q=0.021 human early, 0.070 mouse early, 0.049 conserved early and 0.070 conserved miRNA targets). (c) Taken together, our data show that AKs have acquired many of the properties of cuSCC as assessed by SMG, mutational overlap, mutational signatures, chromosomal instability signature, mRNA and transcription factor profiles and functional pair analysis, although overall mutational load and unsupervised microRNA clustering do enable separation of the three sample types.",ncomms12601-f8

PMC7072164,Figure 1,"Overview of the current understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the efficacy of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) in cancer treatment ① Aquaporins (AQ), often increased in cancer cells, facilitate transition of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) into the cell, while minimal amounts may also diffuse through the cell membrane. ② Lipid peroxidation by free radicals leads to pore formation in the membrane and hence facilitates diffusion of reactive species into the cell. This effect may be enhanced in cancer cells due to reduced levels of cholesterol-a lipid important for providing membrane stability and fluidity. ③ Increased intracellular RONS interfere with calcium signaling (e.g., through interaction with inositol trisphosphate receptor [IP3-RR] and ryanoid receptor [RR]) resulting in increased calcium influx into cytosol. ④ Furthermore, RONS induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to a calcium influx into mitochondria reducing the membrane potential and hence inducing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. ⑤ CAP induced DNA double strand breaks (DSB) cause a DNA damage response including activation of ATM, H2AX, p53, and p73. These DSB may not be a direct effect of CAP on DNA but rather a consequence of CAP induced apoptosis. ⑥ Increased levels of RONS produced by CAP overwhelm the antioxidant system and hence limit its protective effect against oxidative stress. ⑦ Reduced expression of integins after CAP treatment may explain the reduction of adhesion, migration, and invasion after CAP treatment. ⑧ As a consequence of CAP treatment necrosis, apoptosis, and senescence have been reported. Which of these processes is induced seems to be dose-dependent. However, the underlying mechanisms that decide which process of growth arrest or cell death as a consequence of CAP treatment is triggered still need to be further elucidated.

PMC7175378,Figure 1,"Nicotinamide (NAM) metabolism. NAM is a precursor of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and regulates cellular metabolism. NAM is first converted to NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) in the cytoplasm before becoming NAD+. The latter acts a co-enzyme in redox reactions (b) that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or is phosphorylated towards NADP+ (which also takes part in redox reactions). Additionally, NAD+ is a substrate for enzymes in non-redox reactions, where it is cleaved back to NAM (a). The most well-studied enzymes in these reactions are the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and the poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). SIRT1 and PARP1 carry out the protein posttranslational modifications called deacetylation (c) and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation)(d). Notably, while SIRT1 and PARP1 are activated by NAD+ (c) and DNA damage (d), respectively, NAM suppresses both through a negative feedback mechanism (a). NAM produced in non-redox reactions could “go back” to be converted once more to NAD+ via NMN. Alternatively, it could be metabolized to metNAM (methyl-NAM) and subsequently to 4-PY (N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide) and 2-PY (N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide) and excreted through the urine (a).",biomolecules-10-00477-g001

PMC7916193,Figure 6,"Pathways involved in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) pathogenesis. Molecular alterations, which drive cSCC development, have been identified in pathways involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, and mitogenic/survival. (A) The tumor suppressor genes p16INK4A and p14ARF control retinoblastoma (pRb) and p53 pathways, respectively. Their loss of function promotes cell cycle counteracting senescence or apoptosis. Aberrant activation of E2F transcription can also be due to cyclin D activation or pRb expression loss. pRb and p53 inactivation is also mediated by E6 and E7 (red hexagons) human papilloma virus (HPV) proteins. (B) EGF-R aberrant activation, p53 inactivation, or NOTCH gene mutations inactivate the NOTCH pathway. Inactivation of NOTCH abolishes the direct or IRF6-mediated suppression of ΔNp63, favoring proliferation, survival, and stemness. NOTCH inactivation also counteracts senescence and apoptosis mediated by its targets (HES1 and p21). Moreover, ΔNp63 upregulation represses the expression of HES1, p21, and p16INK4A. (C) RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways share the up-stream proteins, such as tyrosine kinase receptors (RTK) and RAS. Activating mutations in RTK, RAS or inactivation of negative regulator RASA1 promotes cell proliferation and survival through constitutive activation of both pathways. Aberrant activation of these pathways can also derive by B-RAF or PI3K/AKT activation, or Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inactivation. The RTKs and the downstream pathways can be targeted with several drugs (blue hexagons) to inhibit cSCC progression. However, both pathways can be activated by RAS mutations, present in photodamaged skin, as part of a compensatory mechanism that could drive resistance to therapeutic targeting strategies. Proteins with commonly accepted tumor promoting and suppressing functions are highlighted in orange and green, respectively.

Proposed molecular model for the mechanistic role of PRECSIT in cSCC; low level of PRECSIT expression is maintained in normal epidermal keratinocytes by p53. The red cross indicates blockage of the downstream signaling. In cSCC cells, mutational inactivation of p53, which leads to loss of p53 expression, results in upregulation and accumulation of PRECSIT in the nucleus. Elevated PRECSIT expression contributes to STAT3 activation and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases collagenase-1 (MMP-1), collagenase-3 (MMP-13), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), and stromelysin-2 (MMP-10). MMP-3 and MMP-10 are capable of degrading several extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including basement membrane type IV collagen, fibronectin, and laminin.

Normal skin (A) contains an epidermis composed of a stratum corneum (SC) on top, an epithelial layer that derives from the basal cell layer (BE), rete pegs that undulate at the basal cell–papillary dermal layer interface (PD). The papillary dermis contains dermal collagen with a resonant frequency of 100 Hz. Pre- (AK) (B) and cancerous lesions (C) (BCC and SCC) contain nodular and linear tumors. Cancerous tumors (BCC and SCC) contain reduced amounts of stratum corneum and lack the undulating rete pegs. The dermal collagen fibers with a resonant frequency of 100 Hz are replaced by lesions with dense fibrous tissue (black spots) that reflect more light back to the detector. The stiffness of the tumor collagen can be determined by measuring the resonant frequency of the material in the black spots. Resonant frequency peaks in cancerous lesions occur at 260 Hz as a result of stiffening of the collagen deposited by tumor cells.",biomolecules-11-01712-g002

PMC10319084,Figure 4.,"Summary: A combination of 5-fluorouracil with photodynamic therapy has additive effects upon antitumor immunity in a murine model of actinic keratosis. When applied to actinic keratoses (AK), 5FU exerts antimetabolite activities including inhibition of TS and damage to DNA and RNA through 5FU misincorporation. This results in activation of p53 and tumor cell death. In addition, 5FU treatment induces long-term antitumor immunity by suppressing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), activating DAMPs, recruiting innate (neutrophils and macrophages) and adaptive (CD3+ and CD8+) immune cell populations and suppressing programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), an immune checkpoint receptor on lymphocytes and other immune cells. Painless PDT (pPDT), when applied to 5FU-pretreated AK lesions, exerts additive effects on tumor eradication by inducing a second line of tumor-regressing response. The pPDT regimen, which induces ICD instead of the typical apoptotic cell death response observed after a conventional PDT regimen, results in activation of DAMPs and recruitment of cells comprising the innate (neutrophils and macrophages) and adaptive (CD3+ and CD8+) immune systems. In summary, a combination of 5FU and PDT, each individually known to induce long-term antitumor immune responses in addition to their more immediate antimetabolite and tumor cell death effects, work together and may synergize to provide better tumor eradication therapy.",nihms-1912501-f0011

PMC10377635,Figure 1,"This figure details the main mechanisms involved in the chemopreventive action of the drugs included in this review. Vit D interacts with vit D receptor (VDR) leading to the formation of a complex which migrates into the nucleus, interacts with DNA, and modulates the expression of cell cycle key regulators. NAM prevents UV-induced ATP depletion and is a precursor of NAD, an enzymatic cofactor, which mediates electron transfer by oscillating between its reduced (NADH) and oxidized (NAD+) states. The latter works as a substrate for PARP, a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair processes. PLE, Astaxanthin (ASX), and β-carotene are antioxidant agents that neutralize ROS, leading to the restoration of molecular oxygen. Retinoids interact with retinoid receptors (RAR or RXR) in the nucleus, thus leading to the formation of RARE complex. This latter acts as transcriptional factor for genes involved in cellular differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis.
