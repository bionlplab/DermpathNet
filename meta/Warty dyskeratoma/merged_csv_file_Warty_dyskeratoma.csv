Original magnification, ×8; scale bar, 2.5 mm). (B) Epidermal invagination can be seen. The stratum corneum is thickened in a complex fashion. A clear layer with strongly positive eosin staining is observed, and thickening of the granular layer is also observed. Ill‐defined structures that were weakly positive for eosin can be seen in the interdigitation. Inflammatory cell infiltration, mainly by lymphocytes and histiocytes, is observable in the vascular circumference in the upper layer of the corium (H&E stain. Original magnification, ×50; scale bar, 500 μm). (C) There are voids above the basal cell layer of the thickened epithelium, and the basal cells exhibit a villous distribution. Round cells (corps ronds) with clear areas (clear halo) around dyskeratotic keratinocytes and nuclei are distributed in the upper stratum spinosum. Hyperkeratotic cells (grains) with elongated nuclei are distributed in the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum (H&E stain. Original magnification, ×200; scale bar, 100 μm).",CCR3-11-e7495-g003
