The extension primer has a 5′ exonuclease-resistance modification and the block probe has a 5′ phosphorate and 3′exonuclease-resistance modification. These two oligos are mixed with genomic DNA, heat-denatured, and then annealed to the same strand of the target DNA fragment. The primer extends and stops until it meets the block probe, and the extension product is then ligated with the block probe by a thermal stable ligase. The above procedure can be repeated n times on the PCR machine using a two-step PCR cycling program. The extension and ligation product is then purified by an exonuclase mixture digestion to remove any DNA fragment with no exonuclease-resistance modification at both ends such as remained primers or probes, primer dimers and genomic DNA, and then amplified using universal NGS PCR primer pairs. A CPELA reaction can include hundreds of extension primer-blocking probe sets and simultaneously amplify hundreds of target DNA fragments for subsequent massively parallel sequencing.DOI:
