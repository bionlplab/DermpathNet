a, b Fibroepithelioma of Pinkus: clinical presentation. Distant and frontal (a) and closer and lateral (b) views of a fibroepithelioma of Pinkus in a 72-year-old man with a history of several biopsy-confirmed basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas and a family history of melanoma. He presented with a 3 × 2-cm pedunculated, flesh-colored to pink nodule on his right trunk which had been present for 10 years. The truncal nodule developed at the site of a robotic prostate surgery incision scar.
